I'll hold onto the artifact for now.[NL]
Finoc, what's the fastest route to Altia?[A]
[Right]Well... Flight, of course. I'm the only[NL]
one capable of that. What's the rush?[A]
[MidLeft]Adlez said he intended to sell[NL]
this to Arcanae. I'd have to[A][NL]
bet they're on their way.[A]
[Right]You're right... I'm not sure of the use[NL]
Altia would have for this. Elanil?[A]
[FarRight]High Priest Izuk may have interest solely[NL]
to keep it out of the hands of either[A][NL]
Arcanae or Cesaria during their war. Both[NL]
countries have an interest in expansion,[A][NL]
and he worries Altia is the next[NL]
target when the war ends.[A]
[Right]I'll quickly fly out and survey[NL]
the land. We don't want to[A][NL]
be surprised by either[NL]
army if they arrive.[A][CloseSpeech][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]Why does Altia remain neutral?[A]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]We had our own issues going on, whatwith[NL]
Adlez' clan. He had this crazy idea of[A][NL]
creating an entire nation of different bandit[NL]
clans. With him gone, that ideal should[A][NL]
die off. But he wasn't the only one. Our[NL]
border has been plagued by bandits for[A][NL]
decades. Hopefully, with this wild[NL]
faction gone, peace will be brought[A][NL]
to this part of Altia and Haedric alike.[A]
[MidLeft]So Altia could soon be joining the war?[A]
[MidRight]It's very pssible. Haedric has[NL]
already expressed their stern[A][NL]
disapproval of Arcanae, and while they[NL]
aren't fond of Cesaria, they have[A][NL]
a mutual agreement. Altia is the only[NL]
neutral nation left.[A][NL][......]
Well...[....] except for Shizon.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadFinoc]
[Tact]! Elanil! Get Arc and Luke![NL]
Scouting squadrons from both[A][NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae are en route.[A]
[MidLeft]Dammit. I was hoping we'd be able[NL]
to make a quick escape. Assemble[A][NL]
everyone outside! I'd rather not fight[NL]
Arcanae and Cesaria simultaneously.[A]
[Right]Do you have the artifact?[A]
[MidLeft]Yes. Let's see what our[NL]
imperialist friends want from us...[A][X]
