[Left][LoadArya][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadKendrick][FarLeft][LoadLuke]They're... Constructs. Bodies created to[NL]
fight, but nothing more. They must've been[A][NL]
made by Higher Beings,[NL]
but what truly are they...?[A]
[FarRight]Allow me...[A]
[Right]Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight]You know me, I used to be a pirate.[NL]
I spent a lot of time in a[A][NL]
lot of different places.[A]
[Left]Kendrick, what are you doing?[A]
[FarRight]You know they won't solve it without[NL]
this added info. I know Xexim wants them[A][NL]
to pass. He really is a softie at heart.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Yeah, he sure seemed like a[NL]
softie when he was about to kill us.[A]
[FarRight]The point is, these are the same things[NL]
that guard the ancient ruins[A][NL]
in Draterus. They're remnants of[NL]
the Vathrylian empire.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]You don't mean... Vathrylian Guardians!?[NL]
I would've thought they'd be gone![A][CloseSpeech]
[Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadArya][Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]Please elaborate, Kendrick.[NL]
How are they here?[A]
[Events]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadXexim]There is no need. I have seen all that[NL]
I need to know. You seem worthy, but[A][NL]
any tests for what I need will need to[NL]
be put on hold. I require your immediate[A][NL]
assistance. Yesterday, I recieved word[NL]
that a branch of the Cesarian[A][NL]
military is en route to Shizon.[A]
[Left]I'll bet they're not[NL]
coming on good terms.[A]
[FarRight]Right. They have naval[NL]
escorts and everything.[A]
[Right]What!? I thought we had an agreement! We[NL]
make our services available to both[A][NL]
countries, and they don't target us...[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]I'd guess with all the hostilities on[NL]
the mainland, traditional diplomacy[A][NL]
has kind of gone out the window, no?[A]
[FarRight]Yes. Unfortunately, very rarely is[NL]
a large portion of the population present[A][NL]
due to job requests and such.[NL]
Especially in times like this.[A]
[Left]Leaders want assassins to kill their[NL]
enemies, be it across countries or not.[A]
[FarRight]I may have respect, but Shizon has no[NL]
leader. I can't call them back. They would[A][NL]
probably answer my call, but it goes[NL]
against my belief in my role here. Even[A][NL]
if I did, they wouldn't get here in time.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]How have you guys lasted so[NL]
long without a leader?[A]
[Right]We make a pact when we agree to become[NL]
Shizonians. When we break the terms of[A][NL]
that pact, the Four Rulings, we die.[NL]
Most minor issues are upheld by[A][NL]
the more respected members, like Xexim.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Bound by a pact, eh? You all certainly[NL]
always have surprises up your sleeves.[A]
[FarRight]We don't have time to discuss all this now.[NL]
I need your help. Defeat the Cesarians[A][NL]
that are coming to attack us.[NL]
I've seen proof of your conviction.[A]
[Left]I think the best option is to split up.[NL]
If they're coming at us from different[A][NL]
angles, it's best for us to[NL]
defend on different fronts.[A]
[FarRight]I will defend the shrine.[NL]
They cannot enter that place.[A]
[Left]Sounds good. Arc, come with me to the[NL]
market district. Arya and Luke,[A][NL]
can you defend the village?[A]
[Right]Of course. Our homes will not[NL]
be destroyed on my watch.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]I'll act as the reserve. I'm[NL]
betting they're using the standard[A][NL]
Cesarian Navy attack strategy.[A]
[Left]And that is...?[A]
[FarRight]Two main squadrons. One will have a high[NL]
ranking officer with them,[A][NL]
likely a Captain or a Lieutenant, while[NL]
the other will mostly be a[A][NL]
distraction. I'll head wherever[NL]
the Captain goes.[A]
[FarLeft]How are they able to be so organized and[NL]
blind to the lives of their troops?[A]
[Right]When you've got an empire with the size and[NL]
diversity of Cesaria, it's not too hard.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadXexim]We are short on time.[NL]
You must go! I feel this will[NL]
be of use to you. Use it well.[A][X]
