Bounty hunters really are[NL]
stubborn, aren't they?[A]
[MidRight]You know what they say...[....] If you[NL]
can't make money off your own merit,[A][NL]
use someone else's lack thereof![A]
[FarLeft]I don't think anyone[NL]
actually says that, Kendrick.[A]
[MidRight]What would I know? I do honest business.[A]
[Left]Right... So, will you help us out?[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Of course! A quick trip into a[NL]
desert never hurt anyone, except of[A][NL]
course, everyone else before us.[A]
[FarLeft]If you say so... Let's get ready[NL]
to head out. How soon can you have[A][NL]
those supplies ready, Kendrick?[A]
[MidRight]I'll have them ready in a jiffy.[NL]
Meet me by the North gate.[A][NL]
That's the closest to Draterus.[A][ClearFace][.......][FarRight][LoadVicar]
Should we tell Kendrick about the plan?[A]
[FarLeft]I feel like we can trust him...[A]
[Left]Don't. If a bounty hunter had an issue with[NL]
Kendrick, he must have done some shady[A][NL]
stuff in his past. I don't want him to know[NL]
about the artifact we hold. He's a useful[A][NL]
ally, but don't be so quick to trust.[A]
[FarLeft]I understand. Are all[NL]
merchants so... slimy?[A]
[Left]Most of them are, yes. They care about[NL]
themselves. That's all. We don't have[A][NL]
time to worry about it, though. Every[NL]
minute we waste is another minute[A][NL]
Haedric could be on our tails.[A][X]
