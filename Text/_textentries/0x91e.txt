[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]Oh, what have we here?[NL]
Another lost spirit? Typical. Always[A][NL]
coming here to the realm of the Guardian[NL]
Spirit. You don't know what that is?[A][NL]
It's a parallel dimension where the[NL]
guardians of the current era watch[A][NL]
and control the balance of the world.[NL]
We also cater to you lost spirits, so[A][NL]
you may get back to your true world.[NL]
What? You don't know about the world[A][NL]
you're in? I should cover that before[NL]
getting to work. This is Avenir. It[A][NL]
is separated into multiple countries[NL]
on the main landmass, surrounded by[A][NL]
the Outer Lands that very few people[NL]
ever travel to, the most notable of[A][NL]
which being the assassin dynasty of[NL]
Shizon. To the southwest lies the[A][NL]
empire of Cesaria, noted for their very[NL]
strong military. The Emperor and General[A][NL]
work together to rule the country. To the[NL]
east of them is Arcanae, a country[A][NL]
entirely based around magic, ruled by their[NL]
council of the Five Grand Magi. The Five[A][NL]
Grang Magi often operate independently of[NL]
each other in their own domains. They[A][NL]
often fight among themselves for power.[NL]
Just north of Arcanae is Haedric, a[A][NL]
warrior nation ruled by the Basileus.[NL]
Their law is maintained by Warlords who[A][NL]
who command small clans, but they are[NL]
fiercely loyal to the Basileus. Within[A][NL]
the long mountain range at the north of[NL]
the continent are the fliers of Altia.[A][NL]
Their Dragon Lord and High Priest rule.[NL]
In the center is the desert of Draterus[A][NL]
where nobody is known to inhabit, but it[NL]
was once the legendary Vathrylian[A][NL]
empire before they destroyed themselves.[NL]
There is also the small state of Bacrun[A][NL]
just east of Draterus between Arcanae[NL]
and Haedric. [.....]Most trade between the[A][NL]
countries flows through there. It's[NL]
technically a city state, but it's grown[A][NL]
so wealthy and essential to trade that[NL]
it may as well be its own empire. Now[A][NL]
that you have a basic understanding of the[NL]
world you're about to inhabit,[A][NL]
what is your name?[A][X]
