[FarRight][LoadAdlez]
Vicar?[Left][LoadVicar][FarLeft][LoadBaret][FarRight] Is that you?[A]
[Left]Adlez! It's been a good long while.[A]
[FarRight]Right you are. Always good to see you.[NL]
old friend. These are the kids?[A]
[FarLeft]Excuse me?[A]
[Left]Adlez and I were good friends in our Haedric[NL]
days. When I found you and your brother,[A][NL]
I left the service of the warlord we were[NL]
under. Adlez left after his death.[A]
[FarRight]Indeed. So, you're here[NL]
to help with the raid?[A]
[Left]Yeah. This is [Tact], by the way. He[NL][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer][Left]
disposed of a group of highwaymen[A][NL]
that also wanted to join the raid,[NL]
then joined up with us.[A]
[FarRight][Tact], you say? What are[NL]
you, a freelancer?[A]
[FarLeft]Yeah, something like that.[A]
[FarRight]Well, if he's a good fighter, that's good[NL]
for me. Anyone who can deal with a whole[A][NL]
group of highwaymen single-handedly is worth[NL]
my attention. I already dispatched[A][NL]
one of my men, Gerwick, to begin the[NL]
assault on Danaan. If you want[A][NL]
some loot, you'd better get going.[A]
[Left]We'll be back with your cut.[A]
[FarRight]I wouldn't have it any other way.[A][X]
