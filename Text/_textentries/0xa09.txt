[FarRight][LoadVicar][Right][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadConnor][FarLeft][LoadAdlez]
So, some of them escaped...[A]
[Left]It's clear what we have[NL]
to do. Go after them.[A]
[Right]I thought the goal was just to loot[NL]
the caravan. Who cares if[A][NL]
some of them got away?[A]
[FarRight]Yercheck is a Warlord village. The[NL]
warriors there are far above our[A][NL]
level. Adlez, you know this.[A]
[FarLeft]Vicar has a fair point.[A]
[Left]But our goal! We need[NL]
what was in that caravan![A]
[Right]What was in that caravan?[A]
[FarRight]What goal?[A]
[Left]Dammit...[A]
[FarLeft]This was all your idea, Connor. You[NL]
might as well explain it to them.[A]
[Left]...[.....] Fine. [Tact] knows this much[NL]
already, but we have ambitions of[A][NL]
uniting all of Avenir under one banner.[NL]
But we obviously lack the manpower[A][NL]
and strength to do so. We're just a[NL]
bandit clan after all. That caravan[A][NL]
was carrying an ancient artifact of[NL]
Vathryl, capable of high-level magic[A][NL]
without the user needing to have[NL]
any ability to channel Vene.[A]
[FarRight]You wanted a way for those of us who[NL]
channel Inge to compete with the[A][NL]
magic-casters channeling Vene... It makes[NL]
sense in concept, but your motives...[A]
[Left]Cesaria and Arcanae's war isn't going to[NL]
end without some form of intervention! If[A][NL]
we're gonna take that step, we might as well[NL]
keep going from there! So long as[A][NL]
different countries exist, so[NL][LoadConnor]
will war and violence![A]
[FarLeft]Connor, calm yourself.[A]
[Left]Sorry, boss.[A]
[FarRight]I definitely understand what you're[NL]
trying to accomplish. Adlez, may [Tact][A][NL]
and I speak to you in private?[A]
[FarLeft]Of course. Connor, check[NL]
up on the men.[A]
[Left]I'm on it boss.[A][ClearFace][......][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
What is it?[A]
[FarRight]This isn't like you.[A]
[MidLeft]What do you mean?[A][CloseSpeech]
[FarRight][MoveRight]You're an idealist, yes. We both are.[NL]
But the senseless slaughter to get to[A][NL]
your goal... Surely, you know it can't[NL]
succeed? With constant rebellion from[A][NL]
the people you subjugate, peace[NL]
will be only an illusion.[A]
[MidLeft]I am fully aware... Connor's ambitions[NL]
are world domination. He masks it under a[A][NL]
facade of wanting peace, but all he wants[NL]
is power. I'm surprised he hasn't made a[A][NL]
move to kill me yet... Perhaps because[NL]
he knows he lacks the loyalty of[A][NL]
the rest of the clan.[A]
[FarRight]Why do you go along with it then?[A]
[MidLeft]I was once a Haedrician warrior serving[NL]
under Warlord Tyrone. Vicar was as well.[A][NL]
About ten years ago, was it? Basileus Leon[NL]
had suddenly become passive. Haedric was[A][NL]
destined to fall apart. The war between[NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae of that time was[A][NL]
growing, and we felt the world was nearing[NL]
destruction. The hero Efil prevented it,[A][NL]
of course, but now I see it happening again,[NL]
and many people are blind to what they[A][NL]
see. I don't want to cause people pain.[NL]
It brings me pain already knowing the[A][NL]
lives I've taken as a bandit.[A]
[FarRight]But you do it anyway. What's your[NL]
goal, Adlez? What do you want?[A]
[MidLeft]I want to find Efil. If anyone can truly[NL]
resolve the dilemma Avenir finds itself[A][NL]
in, it's him. I figured one of the best[NL]
ways to bring him out of hiding was[A][NL]
bring chaos to Haedric and the other[NL]
nations with Connor's plan. But when[A][NL]
he came, I was going to help him,[NL]
in the best way I could.[A]
[FarRight]So... let me get this straight. Connor[NL]
is using you for power, but in fact,[A][NL]
you're using him to get Efil's attention?[NL]
This has got to be the most politically[A][NL]
strategic bandit clan on the continent.[A]
[Right]Adlez, you were willing to sacrifice[NL]
your morals and perhaps even[A][NL]
your life to bring peace.[A]
[FarRight]You really are an idealist.[A]
[MidLeft]Haha! I'm definitely used to hearing that.[NL]
[Tact], Vicar... I want you to help me.[A][NL]
We're going to go to Yerchek and get that[NL]
artifact. With it, Connor's plan[A][NL]
shouldn't be necessary... It has the power [NL]
to awaken old Vathrylian technology, the[A][NL]
kind that caused that kingdom's destruction[NL]
and the events of ten years ago.[A]
[FarRight]I'm in. I'm just a freelancer, sure,[NL]
but I'd like to think I can help.[A]
[Right]These are ideals I have also supported as[NL]
well. However, I'd like to ask Walter and[A][NL]
Baret their opinion. I'll do that later. If[NL]
they want to leave, that's their choice.[A][NL]
I'm sticking around to see how[NL]
this plays out regardless.[A]
[MidLeft]Thank you, both.[A][X]
