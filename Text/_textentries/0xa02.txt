So you're the Shizonian, eh?[A]
[MidLeft]Yes, I'm Arya. You're Vicar,[NL]
correct? More bandits...[A]
[FarRight]Mercenaries. We're friends with Adlez,[NL]
but we're here of our own accord,[A][NL]
not because we're bandits.[A]
[MidLeft]I see...[A]
[Right]I can see the caravan. Looks like a squadron[NL]
of Haedrician Warriors guarding it...[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
Nothing we can't handle. Shall we move in?[A][Right][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Wait one moment...[.......] Ready...[......] They're[NL]
close enough now! Move in![A][X]
