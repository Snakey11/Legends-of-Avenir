[FarRight][LoadArya]

Here we are. Port Selsing. One of the key[NL]
locations in Arcanae for the black market.[A]
[Left][LoadPlayer][Smile]Arya![A][CloseSpeech]
[FarRight][MoveRight][Smile]Ah good, you're here, [Tact]. Arc and[NL]
Luke decided to come along after all.[A]
[Left]I'm glad [FarLeft][Smile][LoadArc][FarRight][LoadLuke][Left]to hear it.[A]
[FarLeft]Aye. She convinced me.[Smile] Can't[NL]
guarantee I'll stick around though.[A]
[Left]Still good to have you along, friend.[NL]
So, Arya, who are we looking for?[A]
[Right]There's a merchant who makes voyages to[NL]
Shizon. I'll try to hunt him down, but[A][NL]
we need to lay low. There tend to[NL]
be some Arcanian officials around.[A]
[Left]I've seen them wandering about, asking some[NL]
people for papers and whatnot. I've[A][NL]
managed to dodge them so far. They'll[NL]
probably pay more attention to us now[A][NL]
that we're a bigger group, though.[A]
[FarRight]I'm no good at lying, but...[....] I[NL]
should be able to bluff my way through[A][NL]
it if they were to talk to us.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArc]You?[A]
[FarRight]I'm the only caster here. Arcanians[NL]
look down upon those who can't channel[A][NL]
Vene with any sort of capability. Trust[NL]
me. It'll go smoother if I handle it.[A]
[Events][.....]
[Right][Smile][Left][Smile]Speak of the devil, Luke.[NL]
I hope you're right about this.[A]
[FarRight]Just play along everybody.[NL]
Please. Trust me.[A][X]
