[MidRight][LoadArya][FarLeft][LoadVicar]
Oh! You're the Shizonian. Arya, was it?[A]
[MidRight]That's right.[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Will you be joining us for[NL]
our raid on Yerchek tomorrow?[A]
[MidRight]That's my plan. I want to get to[NL]
the bottom of whatever Adlez has planned.[A]
[MidLeft]You're an expert information[NL]
gatherer. I'm sure you've already[A][NL]
got it mostly figured out.[A]
[MidRight]Wha-?[A]
[MidLeft]I know you were listening earlier.[NL]
Baret's been keeping an eye on[A][NL]
you. But you're still with us.[A]
[MidRight]...[......] I want to see how this plays out.[NL]
Adlez has the right idea. Even Connor's[A][NL]
concept... If the nations are united, but[NL]
if we kill Connor, it could create peace.[A]
[MidLeft]So that's your reason for sticking[NL]
around... Yes I suppose so... It[A][NL]
depends a lot on how tomorrow goes.[A]
[MidRight]Yes... I trust [Tact]. However[NL]
he opts to proceed is how we'll[A][NL]
do it. I think both plans[NL]
are viable to the end goal.[A]
[MidLeft]I agree. I'm[Smile] glad to have[NL]
you on our side, Arya.[A]
[MidRight]Likewise. Anyway, let's get some[NL]
rest. Tomorrow will be quite the day...[A][X]
