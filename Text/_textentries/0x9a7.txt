[Right][LoadPlayer][FarLeft][Smile][LoadMaximus][FarRight][LoadUzkalis][Smile]
I knew you were a smart one, [Tact].[NL]
Come along, all of you. We have much to[A][NL]
discuss. We'll still pay you for[NL]
the artifact, of course.[A]
[FarLeft]You'll have a knife in your back,[NL]
[Tact]...[....] Until next time.[A][NL]
Tiger Brigade! We head for Cesaria![A][ClearFace][......][FarRight][ClearFace][FarLeft][LoadArc]
[Tact], are you sure about this? Haedric[NL]
and Arcanae aren't exactly friends.[A]
[Right]I know, Arc. But Xavus and Uzkalis[NL]
aren't interested in taking over Avenir.[A][NL]
They just want control over Arcanae and to[NL]
advance their research. Haedric is[A][NL]
safer with them.[A]
[FarLeft]If you say so...[A][Right][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadFinoc]
[Tact], Elanil and I must report back to our[NL]
Anguis. He will be anxious to hear what we[A][NL]
have to report. High Priest Izuk will also be[NL]
interested to hear of this artifact. I[A][NL]
hope that you have made the[NL]
right decision today.[A]
[Left]It's been an honor to fight alongside[NL]
you, Finoc. May you travel in clear skies.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]An old Altian salute...[NL]
Until next time, friend.[A][ClearFace][......][Smile][LoadUzkalis]
Come, you three, come.[A]
[Left]What was the arranged price[NL]
for the artifact?[A]
[FarRight]10,000 gold.[A]
[FarLeft]10,000?! That's more than the[NL]
our entire treasury back home.[A][ClearFace][LoadLuke]
They really had their sights set high...[A]
[Left]You have yourselves a[NL]
deal. Is that all?[A]
[FarRight]No, not at all. You see, I sent a[NL]
missive to the Anguis in Altia,[A][NL]
proposing an alliance to crush Cesaria.[NL]
The natural resources there would[A][NL]
benefit Altia, and removing Cesaria[NL]
would benefit Arcanae. Once negotiations[A][NL]
are complete, I intend to take part of[NL]
our forces through Altia to the border[A][NL]
with Cesaria. We will attack on two fronts.[NL]
I want you to be a squadron commander.[A]
[Left]Me? We just met.[A]
[FarRight]Yes, but this artifact has been one[NL]
of much intrigue to Xavus. You deserve[A][NL]
more than just the gold it's worth. You[NL]
deserve honor. Plus, you Haedricans[A][NL]
are far more acclimated to the rocky[NL]
terrain. We of Arcanae struggle[A][NL]
in rough areas.[A]
[Left]I don't know...[A]
[FarRight]Also, we can't risk you leaving to[NL]
alert any Cesarians of our sneak[A][NL]
attack. We'd have to kill you[NL]
if you don't accept.[A]
[Left]Giving me a lot of choices. Very well.[NL]
Arc and Luke will come with me[A][NL][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]
Do I have a say in the matter?[A][CloseSpeech]
[Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Oh. Of course you do. Both of you do.[A]
[Left][LoadLuke]There's nothing for me in Danaan anyway.[NL]
I'd rather travel and learn.[A]
[FarLeft]I can't say the same. The prospect[NL]
of fighting with Arcanians doesn't[A][NL]
have me feeling great. I'd like to[NL]
return to Danaan first. I really[A][NL]
don't give a rat's ass about Arcanae[NL]
or Cesaria or the war, Uzkalis.[A][NL]
I'll just go to home to Danaan.[A][CloseSpeech]
[Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke][Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]Very well. Uzkalis?[A]
[FarRight]I...[....] may have some information of[NL]
interest to Arc, actually. We passed[A][NL]
by...[.....] Danaan, is it? On the way here.[NL]
Bandits were attacking. Adlez must have[A][NL]
dispatched some men to deal with the[NL]
remains of the town. We stepped in to[A][NL]
stop them, but the town was burned[NL]
to the ground. I'm sorry.[A]
[FarLeft]...[.......] My home. It's...[LoadArc][....] gone.[NL]
I have to back. Rebuild.[A]
[Right]Arc. You know that there's nothing[NL]
left. Just memories. Join us[A][NL]
and leave the past behind.[A]
[FarLeft]...[.....] *sigh* You're right. I'll[NL]
travel with you, [Tact].[A]
[FarRight]For now, you all should get some rest.[NL]
We all set out tomorrow. I imagine[A][NL]
the Anguis will have a messenger[NL]
en route to us by then.[A]
[Left]Understood.[A][X]
