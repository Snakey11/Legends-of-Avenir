So that's their game...[A]
[FarLeft]I never realized just how much political[NL]
plotting happened in a bandit clan...[A]
[MidRight]That's just how it is.[NL]
What will you two do?[A]
[Left]I don't really have a purpose I'm following[NL]
right now. I'll go with you, Vicar.[A]
[FarLeft]I'm with Baret. If you think it's good[NL]
to follow along and see what's[A][NL]
happening, that's good enough for me.[A]
[MidRight]Thank you, both. I hope you know that[NL]
you have no reason to remain bound to me.[A][NL]
I saved your lives, yes, but that means[NL]
precious little if you don't have the[A][NL]
freedom to do what you want.[A]
[FarLeft]This is what I want.[A]
[Left]Likewise.[A]
[MidRight]Tomorrow, we head out for Yerchek.[NL]
Warlord Tyrone will likely be[A][NL]
there... It'll be a tough[NL]
fight. Get your rest.[A][X]
