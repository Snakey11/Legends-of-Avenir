[MidLeft][LoadLuke][MidRight][LoadArya]Get out of my way.[NL]
You aren't my target.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Stop! Why do you fight?[A][NL]
[MidRight]It is my duty, as my contract decrees.[NL]
We all have our reasons.[A][NL]
Why would you even care?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I'm having doubt about...[.......][NL]
well...[.......] everything. What do the[NL]
Higher Beings truly want with us[NL]
Lower Beings? Why would they care?[A][NL]
[MidRight]Oh you're a monk are you?[NL]
Get out of my way. If you survive[A][NL]
this battle, maybe there will be a[NL]
chance for you to discover.[A][NL]
But if you die now...[.....][A][NL]
[MidLeft]I don't think you're doing[NL]
something you want to either.[A][NL]
[MidRight]What?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]You've hesitated thus far. Why?[A][NL]
[MidRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]I don't like this.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Why?[A][NL]
[MidRight][TMM][.......]... [......][TMM]My contract said[NL]
nothing about banditry.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Then come with us.[NL]
We can find our way together.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Perhaps. What is your name?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Luke.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Very well then, Luke.[....] I am Arya.[Smile][NL]
Maybe I can help you uncover your truths.[A][X]
