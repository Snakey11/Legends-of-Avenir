[Left][LoadAdlez]He had outlived his[NL]
usefulness. Connor![A][FarRight][LoadConnor]
I'm here, Adlez.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveMidRight]
[Left]Take a group of men and head back to[NL]
Danaan. Burn it to the ground and[A][NL]
take everything you can from it.[A]
[MidRight]But of course. What of you?[A]
[Left]I'm heading to the lair. Arcanae made a[NL]
very nice offer for that artifact, so[A][NL]
I'm gonna make sure to have it in nice[NL]
condition when they arrive for it.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveMidLeft]
[MidRight]Understood.[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][ClearFace][MidRight]
That fool.[.] He may be our leader, but Cesaria[NL]
and Arcanae will keep up-paying each[A][NL]
other as long as we hold that[NL]
artifact.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadConnor]
You there![A][FarRight][LoadBandit1]
Yeah?[A]
[MidLeft]Send a letter to Cesaria about the[NL]
artifact. Tell them Arcanae has[A][NL]
made a good offer on it.[A]
[FarRight]Will do.[A][ClearFace][......][LoadBandit3]
Connor! We've spotted a small group coming[NL]
from the road towards Danaan![A]
[MidLeft]Dammit! Gerwick failed again. Typical.[NL]
Alright men, ready up! We've got a whole[A][NL]
lot of money coming our way if we can kill[NL]
these fools here and now! You! Go take[A][NL]
a few men to Danaan again.[NL]
You know what to do.[A][X]
