[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadArc]Some people...[A]
[Left]Calm down Arc, please.[A]
[Right]It doesn't matter now. Let's go.[A][FarRight][LoadArya]
[Left]Arc![.] Behind you![A][MoveMidLeft][FarRight][LoadArya]
[Right]Eh?[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc][FarRight][MoveRight][Left][ClearFace][FarRight][LoadArc]
[Right]Ah! Stop! Let go![A]
[FarRight]Who are you? Who sent you?[A]
[Right]I'm from Shizon.[....] I was sent to kill you.[A]
[FarLeft]You were one of them,[.] weren't you?[NL]
I never thought as Shizonians as bandits.[A]
[Right]I never did either. I've dishonored[NL]
my people by following this contract.[A][NL]
[FarRight]I wish you luck in the afterlife![A]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft]Stop! She clearly wasn't loyal to the[NL]
bandits themselves. We should let her go.[A]
[Right]I...[.......] I want to make this up to you and[NL]
prove to you that we are not so barbaric.[A][NL]
I want you all to come back[NL]
with me. To Shizon.[A]
[FarRight]You are honorable people. Good[NL]
fighters. You would be welcome there.[A]
[Right]You are honorable people. Good fighters.[NL]
You would be welcome there.[A]
[FarLeft]You've all turned your back on[NL]
the Higher Beings, though.[A]
[Right]Please, Luke. You'll understand if you[NL]
just come. Arc, with these bandits dead,[A][NL]
there's nothing left of Gerwick's clan.[A]
[Left]Hold up. My job is guarding the caravan.[NL]
I can't leave that unfinished.[A]
[FarRight]There's a checkpoint just a few miles[NL]
down the road. We can stop there[A][NL]
and finish this discussion then.[A]
[Left]I'm interested. I want to see the world.[NL]
I've always wanted to go, and this[A][NL]
may be my only chance. Are you two in?[A]
[FarLeft]Danaan is my home. You can hardly expect[NL]
me to just abandon them like this.[A]
[Left]I also.[A]
[FarRight]As Arc said, there's a checkpoint[NL]
down the road. Let's finish[A][NL]
this discussion there.[A]
[Right]Sounds good to me.[A][X]
