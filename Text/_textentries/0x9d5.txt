Ah, you're here, [Tact]. Thank you.[A]
[MidRight]So what's the word?[A]
[Left]Vice-Captain Lux here was scouting out in[NL]
Draterus to keep track of Uzkalis'[A][NL]
movements. She had just started her report[NL]
when I decided to send for you.[A]
[MidRight]Understood.[A]
[FarLeft]Sir, thank you, sir. I was tracking the[NL]
movements of Arcanae through the desert.[A][NL]
They seemed to be heading for various[NL]
locations of ruins, but took a slight detour.[A][NL]
I don't think they had originally been[NL]
prepared to journey into Draterus itself, so[A][NL]
they took a detour to stop at an Oasis.[A]
[MidRight]Are those rare in the desert?[A]
[Left]Very. Because of that, we have a good[NL]
idea of where Uzkalis and his men[A][NL]
are right now. Continue, Lux.[A]
[FarLeft]Last I checked, they had divided their forces,[NL]
likely to widen their search for artifacts.[A][NL]
Many of them still reside at the Oasis. I[NL]
believe that if we attack that group and[A][NL]
capture the Oasis, we could scatter[NL]
a large portion of Uzkalis' men.[A]
[Left]That definitely seems like a good plan. I[NL]
have to return to Cesaria and mobilize the[A][NL]
rest of the Tiger Brigade, I understand that[NL]
Xavus' main force is moving towards the[A][NL]
border. Lux, [Tact], I leave you two to lead[NL]
the operation in Draterus. I'll leave a few[A][NL]
graduated cadets as well. Derek! Jasper![A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadDerek]
Private Derek reporting for duty.[A][ClearFace][LoadJasper]
Private Jasper, sir![A]
[Left]You're being sent into Draterus with the[NL]
Vice-Captain and [Tact], here.[A][NL]
You'll be answering to them.[A]
[FarRight]Understood.[A]
[Left]I will return as soon as I[NL]
am able. I wish you all luck.[A]
[FarLeft]Godspeed, Captain.[A][CloseSpeech][Left][ClearFace]
[Right]See you around. So when[NL]
do we move out, Lux?[A]
[FarLeft]Likely in about an hour. Go[NL]
speak with your friends for now.[A]
[Right]Will do.[A][X]
