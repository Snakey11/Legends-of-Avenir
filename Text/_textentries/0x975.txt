[FarLeft][LoadJurgen]So this is the small band that's[NL]
destroyed my brigade. Of course I[A][NL]
have to handle things myself.[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadKendrick]Captain Jurgen of the[NL]
Cesarian Lion Brigade...[A]
[Right][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadLuke]Kendrick? Do you know him?[A]
[FarRight]He used to serve as the Lieutenant and[NL]
Vice-Captain under the current General,[A][NL]
Rex. He's very levelheaded and skilled. He[NL]
often led their navy against[A][NL]
me during my... ah... Old days.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArc][Left]So he'll be a bit of a challenge.[A]
[FarLeft]I doubt he'll try to[NL]
face us all by himself.[A]
[FarRight]You'd be right, there. He's always[NL]
been a cautious fighter. I bet if we[A][NL]
destroy enough of his troops, he'll retreat.[NL]
We won't be able to all gang up on[A][NL]
him, though. He'll keep his elite[NL]
soldiers by his side.[A]
[Right]It's fine. I've not met a group I feel[NL]
more comfortable fighting alongside[A][NL]
than you all. Let's do this.[A][X]
