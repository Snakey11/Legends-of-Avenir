[Left][LoadArc][Right][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadKendrick][FarLeft][LoadXexim]
I won't blame any of you[NL]
for turning back now.[A]
[Right]I'm a Shizonian. I stand by you.[A]
[FarRight]If we remove Rex, lots of people in[NL]
Cesaria will seek aid from merchants[A][NL]
like me. I see it as worth it.[A]
[Left]If Cesaria's looking to expand, Haedric[NL]
is up next, including Danaan. This[A][NL]
will be more help to my home than me[NL]
sitting around doing nothing.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke]
You allowed me to understand the truth of[NL]
Higher Beings. I would jump at[A][NL]
any opportunity to aid you.[A][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
[FarLeft]And you, [Tact]?
[FarRight][MoveRight]This is the path I have chosen.[NL]
I will stick to it.[A]
[FarLeft]Very well. Here's the plan. We will[NL]
wait for the cover of darkness. Once[A][NL]
we have it, we'll slip into the castle and[NL]
make our way towards General Rex's[A][NL]
chambers. I have no qualms with many of the[NL]
castle residents and would prefer to[A][NL]
only kill General Rex, but if things go[NL]
sour, we may have to fight some[A][NL]
of his men as well.[A]
[Right]The Dragon Brigade? Are[NL]
we up to the task?[A]
[FarLeft]You'd better be. If all goes well, we[NL]
can slip in and slip out. They'll[A][NL]
assume Arcanae hired someone to assassinate[NL]
Rex and turn towards trying to avenge[A][NL]
him while also trying to fill a power[NL]
vacuum. All the while, we of Shizon[A][NL]
can repair the damage done to us.[A][X]
