[MidRight][LoadPlayer]
Did I make the right choice? What will[NL]
become of the citizens of Cesaria?[A]
[Pause]
[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]
A war... Rather different, but also typical[NL]
at the same time. It's only natural for[A][NL]
you to have sympathy for those lives you've[NL]
changed, and also those you've ended.[A]
[MidRight]What the!? Who are you!?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't recall? Probably better that way.[NL]
I am the Guardian Spirit. I'm the one[A][NL]
who gave you this life, lost soul.[A]
[MidRight]Lost soul...[....] It's coming back...[NL]
You caused this?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course! It gets awfully boring just[NL]
watching people fight back and forth.[A][NL]
Unfortunately, I lose my power if I allow this[NL]
to get out of hand, so it's really only[A][NL]
worth the entertainment.[A]
[MidRight]Wait, what are you suggesting?[A]
[MidLeft]I'm suggesting this is where your story[NL]
ends, [Tact]. I kill you, and roll back[A][NL]
time to before you're existence.[NL]
All is well.[A]
[MidRight]You're awful.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Oh no, I'm so wounded by a lost soul[NL]
telling me how awful I am. Come at me![A][X]
