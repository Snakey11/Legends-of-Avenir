Ah, the mercantile city-state of Bacrun...[A]
[Left]How long has it been?[A]
[FarLeft]Too long.[A]
[Right]You've been here before?[A]
[FarLeft]Aye. Tyrone would send us to try and[NL]
negotiate for luxuries.[A]
[FarRight]I always thought Haedrician Warlords[NL]
lived a more spartan lifestyle...[A]
[Left]To an extent of course. Walter, Baret,[NL]
could you two scout ahead?[A][NL]
Make sure our route is clear.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
I'm on it.[A][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
I'll cover you, brother.[A][ClearFace][LoadConnor]
[FarLeft]Connor, keep an eye out for Leon's signal.[NL]
When you see the flash, we start moving.[A]
[FarRight]Shouldn't I help with the planning?[A]
[FarLeft]Shut up, Connor. Of course not.[A]
[FarRight]Right. Sorry, boss.[A][ClearFace][LoadArya]
You're really getting tired[NL]
of that one, aren't you?[A]
[FarLeft]He keeps assuming he's important. It drives[NL]
me nuts. He wanted to 'lead' our new[A][NL]
nation, but I trust Leon far more than[NL]
Connor. He has no morals.[A]
[Right]I can tell. Not that we're exactly[NL]
princes right now. I mean, we are[A][NL]
ransacking the central hub of Avenir's[NL]
whole economy. Anyway,  Adlez, what[A][NL]
do you happen to know about the mercenary[A][NL]
group that operates in Bacrun?[A]
[FarLeft]Their leader's name is Harken. He's an[NL]
extremely skilled fighter, negotiator,[A][NL]
and leader. There's a reason the council[NL]
hires him, to put it mildly.[A]
[FarRight]What about his men?[A]
[FarLeft]Most of them originated in Haedric, just[NL]
by nature of our culture. They have the[A][NL]
fighting skills of Haedricians, but the[NL]
organization of a true military force.[A][NL]
Bacrun's independence is largely[NL]
attributed to them.[A]
[Right]So we need to keep our heads level.[A]
[FarLeft]Right. Even though we shouldn't face too[NL]
many thanks to Leon, they're all highly[A][NL]
trained. Even a small number could be[NL]
tough to deal with. But I think[A][NL]
we have a good group here.[A]
[Right]I agree.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
I'm back. Everything is largely clear[NL]
out there. Obviously some men stand[A][NL]
guard, but nothing too worrisome.[A]
[FarLeft]Not to mention Leon's distraction[NL]
hasn't quite started yet.[A]
[Right]I wouldn't be too quick to say[NL]
that. Leon just sent the signal.[A]
[FarRight]Walter should be returning[NL]
soon with an update, then.[A]
[FarLeft]So this is it, huh?[A]
[Left]Don't get too hasty. Capturing[NL]
Bacrun is the easy part.[A]
[FarLeft]You're right. Here comes Walter.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
Most of the force is[NL]
moving away. Let's go.[A]
[Left]We have to move quickly. The less time Leon[NL]
is under pressure, the better. We[A][NL]
can't hope to take on Cesaria[NL]
and Arcanae if Leon's force[A][NL]
is dead. Move out![A][X]
