[Right][LoadPlayer][FarLeft][LoadFinoc]
[Tact]! I have news![A]
[Right]What is it? You seem flustered.[A][CloseSpeech]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]Captain Maximus... He and Uzkalis are[NL]
engaged with each other! But it's not[A][NL]
looking good for the Tiger Brigade...[A]
[Right]What!? Lux! Get over here![A][FarRight][LoadLux]
What is it?[A]
[MidLeft]Maximus returned to intercept Uzkalis,[NL]
but he's having a hard time. It[A][NL]
looked like he was losing ground.[A]
[FarRight]Maximus... Dammit![A]
[Right]Lux, control yourself! Stay calm![A]
[FarRight]You don't understand... Maximus was the[NL]
one who told me to enlist. I was from a[A][NL]
small village on the outskirts of the[NL]
capital... My mother had died when I[A][NL]
was young, and one day, a debt collector[NL]
killed my father. Maximus took me under[A][NL]
his wing. He's the reason I am who I am today.[NL]
We have to hurry to his rescue.[A]
[Right]Lux... I understand. Finoc,[NL]
how far are they?[A]
[MidLeft]Not too far. We should be able to get[NL]
there and aid them if we're fast.[A]
[FarRight]Derek! Jasper! Break's over,[MidLeft][ClearFace][FarRight][NL]
we're moving double time![A][FarLeft][LoadJasper][Left][LoadDerek]
Oh come on, Vice-Captain! You've been[NL]
pushing us like mad for days now![A]
[FarRight]I don't care! Captain Maximus is[NL]
in danger! We have to move now![A][ClearFace][......][LoadArc]
[Tact], are you sure she's fine?[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][Right][MoveMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
We have to put our faith in her. This could[NL]
be our last battle. If we defeat Uzkalis,[A][NL]
and word reaches Xavus, he may surrender.[A][Right][LoadLuke]
We've come so far...[NL]
What about afterwards?[A]
[Pause]
[MidLeft]I intend to continue journeying[NL]
around as a mercenary.[A]
[FarRight]Aye. That definitely has appeal to me. But I[NL]
think I'd like to start trying to get the[A][NL]
Warlords to work together in Haedric...[NL]
Prevent another Danaan.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]I respect that, Arc. A[NL]
very noble thing to do...[A]
[Right]I'm going to help with reconstruction[NL]
in Arcanae. I'm sure many homes and farms[A][NL]
have been destroyed due to the war both[NL]
with Cesaria and between the Magi...[A]
[MidLeft]I suppose I hadn't considered the fact[NL]
that this was also an internal[A][NL]
civil war for Arcanae.[A]
[Right]Yeah. I want to do my part to help.[A]
[MidLeft]I wouldn't expect anything different from[NL]
you, Luke. Anyways, we have to get going.[A]
[Right]Yes. I look forward to[NL]
this last battle together.[A]
[MidLeft]It has been an honor, friends.[A][X]
