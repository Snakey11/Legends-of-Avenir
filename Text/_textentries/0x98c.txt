[MidLeft][LoadArya][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadLuke]
We made it out... but... Xexim...[A]
[MidLeft]He knew this day was coming.[NL]
In a way, I think he was hoping[A][NL]
for it to end this way...[A]
[Right]What do you mean?[A]
[MidLeft]Xexim's been alive for around a[NL]
thousand years. Once you've been[A][NL]
alive that long, it gets pretty stale.[A]
[FarRight]But... Who is left who can[NL]
communicate with the Higher Beings?[A]
[MidLeft]Nobody. That was something that[NL]
Xexim chose to keep to himself[A][NL]
and never shared with any of us.[A]
[Right]So what does this mean[NL]
about the fate of Shizon?[A]
[MidLeft]With Xexim dead? We'll probably all[NL]
scatter. Find odd jobs here and there.[A][NL]
Even if someone were to step up to[NL]
fill the role, nobody in Shizon[A][NL]
held the respect Xexim did...[A]
[FarRight]So does that mean...[A]
[MidLeft]The Higher Beings will fade into[NL]
obscurity, as they already were.[A][NL]
We're likely the only ones left who[NL]
know the real truth about them.[A]
[Right]Where will you go, Arya?[A]
[MidLeft]Draterus. It may be the death of me,[NL]
but I want to search the ruins there[A][NL]
and see if I can find something that may[NL]
be able to help me reestablish Shizon.[A][NL]
Some old historical anecdote or something.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadKendrick]
If you find any artifacts that[NL]
could fetch a nice price...[A]
[Right]Kendrick, I don't think[NL]
it's the time for that.[A]
[FarRight]Arya, as much as I'd love to help[NL]
you... Arc and I have our home.[A]
[Left]I understand, Luke.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]
Aye. Danaan is waiting for us.[A]
[Right]What does this mean I'll do?[A]
[Left]You no longer have a home in Shizon.[NL]
Cesaria will be seeking their revenge,[A][NL]
and with Xexim dead, there's no chance[NL]
they'll hold back. They know they can[A][NL]
destroy Shizon once and for all now...[NL]
There's no one left in Shizon strong[A][NL]
enough to lead us to repel another attack.[A]
[Right]So I guess it's back to[NL]
freelancing for me...[A]
[Left]Just stay out of Cesaria.[NL]
They'll know our faces now...[A]
[Right]I understand. Thank you all. Even[NL]
if we weren't able to save Xexim and[A][NL]
Shizon... We accomplished our mission.[A]
[Left]Take care, [Tact].[A]
[FarLeft]If you're ever struggling[NL]
for work, just find me. I can[A][NL]
always use a few helping hands.[A]
[FarRight]Aye. If you need somewhere[NL]
safe, Danaan will always welcome you.[A]
[Left]Thank you, both. Farewell, my friends.[A][X]
