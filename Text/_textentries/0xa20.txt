Vicar, why are we here?[A]
[MidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[FarRight]This isn't like us. We're mercenaries,[NL]
not bandits. War brings us profit.[A][NL]
Why do we want to end the war?[A]
[MidLeft]You two said you'd trust me.[A]
[FarRight]And you said we could do as we like. You[NL]
know me; I'm fine with whatever so[A][NL]
long as I can fight. But I prefer to[NL]
know what I'm fighting for.[A]
[MidLeft]And you feel the same way, Walter?[A]
[Right]For the most part, yeah.[A]
[MidLeft]I suppose I do owe it to you two... As you[NL]
both know, I used to serve under Warlord[A][NL]
Tyrone with Adlez. But... We never agreed[NL]
with Tyrone's morals. He advocated peace[A][NL]
with separation, in other words, desiring[NL]
countries to remain separated but at peace[A][NL]
with each other. The same would go for[NL]
Haedric's fiefdoms. Adlez and I both saw[A][NL]
it as a naive view.[A]
[FarRight]He was a fool, you're saying?[A]
[MidLeft]Not necessarily. He had good ideas. But[NL]
he was stubborn. At the same time, though,[A][NL]
peace is necessary. War only brings[NL]
destruction. Look at what happened to[A][NL]
Vathryl. It was once a magnificent empire,[NL]
the crown piece of Avenir. Now it's a[A][NL]
scorched desert, little more than a shadow.[NL]
A blight. People will always have problems,[A][NL]
even if we unite Avenir. Mercenaries like us[NL]
will still find work, no matter how[A][NL]
peaceful times are. Adlez knows other[NL]
bandit clans will still roam. There's no[A][NL]
hope of uniting all of Avenir under one[NL]
banner, of course. He knows this, I[A][NL]
know this, Leon knows this.[A]
[Right]Why are we trying then?[A]
[MidLeft]The goal is simply to end the war between[NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae, without picking a[A][NL]
side. This is something I wholeheartedly[NL]
support. Even if we do end up just[A][NL]
uniting all of Avenir under one banner,[NL]
I believe its a better situation[A][NL]
than tearing people from their[NL]
families to fight a meaningless war.[A]
[Right]I understand. This is an ideal you and Adlez[NL]
have held for a long time, isn't it?[A]
[MidLeft]Yes. I was too cowardly to help him[NL]
realize it. I don't intend to abandon him[A][NL]
now. Hearing this, what will you two do?[A]
[Right]I stand with you, of[NL]
course. I trust them.[A]
[MidLeft]Baret?[A]
[FarRight]I will help them realize their goal,[NL]
but I have no intention of sticking[A][NL]
around afterwards. I just want[NL]
to be a mercenary.[A]
[MidLeft]I understand. I don't yet know what[NL]
I'll do when Adlez' dream is realized.[A][NL]
Perhaps I will[Smile] join you, Baret. I'm sorry[NL]
I kept so much hidden from you two.[A][NL]
Let's finish this cleaning up and[NL]
turn in for the night.[A]
[Right][Smile]Yes, please. All this fighting[NL]
is making me sore.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]Thank you for[NL]
trusting us, Vicar.[A][X]
