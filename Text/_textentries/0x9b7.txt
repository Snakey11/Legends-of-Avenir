[FarLeft][LoadHelmer]
[Tact]! Elanil and Val are back.[A][ClearFace][LoadVal][Left][LoadElanil][Right][LoadPlayer]
Wha-? Oh. Thank you. What's[NL]
the word, you two?[A]
[Pause]
[Left]The Dragon Brigade is in the city. We saw[NL]
no sign of Maximus and the Tiger Brigade.[A][NL]
We'd have to guess that both the Tiger[NL]
and the Lion Brigade are facing[A][NL]
down Xavus and his troops.[A]
[FarLeft]They're mostly [FarRight][LoadFinoc][FarLeft]concentrated near the palace.[NL]
People in town seem to be going about their[A][NL]
lives normally. I'd guess we'd be able to slip[NL]
in and head for the palace fairly easily.[A]
[Right]Is General Rex in the city?[A]
[Left]We're not sure. We'd have to guess yes,[NL]
though. The Dragon Brigade is on full[NL][A]
alert. Very few leaders have the[NL]
integrity to keep their men that way.[A]
[Right]Very well. We'll have to just enter the city[NL]
and push through. What's security like?[A]
[FarLeft]Pretty awful outside of the palace.[NL]
Nobody questioned two female foreigners[A][NL]
wandering about. Foolish Cesarians...[A]
[FarRight]So we're good.[A]
[Right]Yes. Let's go now, while we have the cover[NL]
of night. It'll make little difference[A][NL]
once we're inside the palace, it but[NL]
should help in the city streets.[A][X]
