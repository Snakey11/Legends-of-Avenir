[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadAdlez][MidRight][LoadTyrone]
[CloseEyes]Dammit... Now there's nothing[NL]
between you all and Haedric...[A]
[Left]Tyrone... You were a good[NL]
man. You died with honor.[A]
[MidRight]Do not...[....] Let me be...[....] forgotten...[A][ClearFace]
[Left]I won't.[.....] [Tact], what now?[A]
[FarLeft]The Mayor is dead. The artifact is ours for[NL]
the taking. Baret, Walter,[FarRight][LoadWalter][Right][LoadBaret][FarLeft] search[A][NL]
the building for it.[A]
[FarRight]You can count on me![A][ClearFace]
[Right]I'm on it.[A][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadVicar]What do you intend to do now?[A]
[FarLeft]Having killed the mayor and Tyrone, I don't[NL]
think we have a whole lot of choice on how[A][NL]
to move forward. If we abandon Connor's[NL]
plan now, we have no forces to[A][NL]
defend from the coming battle.[A]
[Left]I feared this would be the case... If only[NL]
we had been able to reason with them...[A]
[MidRight]How should we proceed[NL]
from here, then?[A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight]
[FarRight][LoadArya]If I may?[A]
[FarLeft]Of course, Arya.[A]
[FarRight]The first step in this is obviously to[NL]
capture Haedric. But... There's no reason[A][NL]
to eradicate them. Basileus Leon is smart.[NL]
If we could somehow... Reach out to him?[A][NL]
It's well-known that he as well wishes to[NL]
end the war, but doesn't like either side[A][NL]
of the conflict all that much. Perhaps[NL]
maybe he would be willing to go along[A][NL]
with our plan, so to speak?[A]
[Left]Connor and I had discussed the[NL]
potential for that before, but do[A][NL]
you really think it's a possibility?[A]
[FarRight]Shizon keeps tabs on all the rulers and[NL]
politics of Avenir. Basileus Leon lacks[A][NL]
confidence in his own rule, but we believe[NL]
that's the only reason he's never taken[A][NL]
steps to do what you all intend to do now.[A]
[Right]The Basileus? Hm...[A]
[Left]It's a concept that's[NL]
definitely out there.[A]
[FarLeft]What kind of man is[NL]
the Basileus, anyway?[A]
[Right]Leon is... unique among people who have[NL]
held the title of Basileus. While[A][NL]
they're historically selected by a[NL]
tournament, Leon actually rose to his[A][NL]
position when the previous Basileus,[A][NL]
a man named Servius, dubbed him his[NL]
successor and disappeared. That[A][NL]
being said, Leon is still a[NL]
fearsome warrior and a strong leader.[A]
[Left]Leon has done a lot. He's repaired relations[NL]
with a lot of the Warlords, so Haedric is[A][NL]
all-in-all more united now than it ever was[NL]
before. I feel like, if we got him our[A][NL]
side, many of the Warlords would follow.[A]
[FarLeft]What reason does he have to want[NL]
to ally with us though? We killed[A][NL]
Tyrone and stole an artifact.[A]
[FarRight]Haedric may be one nation connected by a[NL]
strong sense of nationalism, but that[A][NL]
doesn't make all of the leaders friends.[NL]
It's almost tradition that every Basileus[A][NL]
wants the Warlords who aren't his friends[NL]
dead. It creates less conflict of opinion.[A]
[Left]Tyrone was not popular with Leon. He was[NL]
the longest serving Warlord, appointed by[A][NL]
the previous Basileus. He always believed[NL]
that, if Haedric had endured as separate[A][NL]
fiefdoms for so long, there was no[NL]
reason to try and unite them. He was[NL]
also violently opposed to any[A][NL]
sort of involvement with the war[NL]
between Cesaria and Arcanae.[A]
[Right]Leon advocated for a council, similar to[NL]
Arcanae, but with the Basileus serving[A][NL]
as a chairman of sorts. I don't think Arya's[NL]
idea is far-fetched. Let's head back and[A][NL]
talk with Connor. This will definitely[NL]
require some planning...[A][X]
