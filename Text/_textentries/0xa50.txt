[Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadAdlez][FarLeft][LoadEfil]
Are you the ones who[NL]
opened the way in here?[A]
[Right]Yes. I'm sorry that the[NL]
Wanderers followed us in...[A]
[FarLeft]It's alright. We all emerged[NL]
unscathed, did we not?[A]
[Right]That's true...[A]
[FarLeft]But let's not stall. You must have[NL]
come here wanting something, no?[A]
[FarRight]That's right. There's[NL]
a war aboveground.[A]
[FarLeft]I know. Between Arcanae and Cesaria. I would[NL]
have hoped the conflict with Kilthel ten[A][NL]
years ago would have taught something.[A][Right][MoveLeft][Right][LoadKendrick]
Not everyone took that issue to heart, Efil.[A]
[FarLeft]Kendrick, is that you? Not like[NL]
you to be underground. I thought[A][NL]
you liked the open seas...[A]
[Right]I left that life behind me.[A]
[Left]You know Kendrick?[A]
[FarLeft]First, introductions. So,[NL]
who are the rest of you?[A]
[Left]I'm [Tact]. Just a freelancer.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
I'm Walter. I'm a mercenary under Vicar.[A][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
Baret. Same as Walter.[A][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
I'm Vicar, the leader of my[NL]
small group of mercenaries.[A]
[FarLeft]You must all be from Haedric, then?[A][Right][ClearFace][LoadArya]
Not me. I'm Arya, a Shizonian[NL]
in service to Adlez.[A]
[FarLeft]A Shizonian, eh? One of Xexim's bunch?[A]
[Right]How do you know Xexim?[A]
[FarLeft]I got around in my journeys. Anyone who[NL]
needs information knows the Lord of[A][NL]
Shizon is a good place to go.[A]
[Right]He's not a Lord. Just our leader.[A]
[FarLeft]Yes, yes, I know. I take[NL]
it you must be Adlez, then?[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadAdlez]
Yes. I'm a former bandit leader, but this all[NL]
was my idea. We tire of the war between[A][NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae. We've been searching[NL]
for a way to intervene, and this seems[A][NL]
like the most realistic option.[A]
[FarLeft]Realistic option? Who do you think[NL]
I am, a god? I am just a man, no[A][NL]
different from any other man.[A]
[FarRight]Yes, but you're respected among their[NL]
leaders! If you come with us,[A][NL]
we can reason with them![A]
[FarLeft]You grossly overestimate my influence. I[NL]
may be the one associated with stopping[A][NL]
Kilthel, but it wasn't just me. If the others[NL]
who journeyed with me chose to forget[A][NL]
why we fought, that is their problem.[A]
[FarRight]But it's become our problem too![NL]
International trade is being disrupted,[A][NL]
Haedric is being torn in two trying to decide[NL]
whether to remain neutral or join the[A][NL]
conflict! If something isn't done, then stopping[NL]
Kilthel ten years ago won't have mattered.[A]
[FarLeft]But you see-[A][Right][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]
Efil, I've seen it up there too. We weren't[NL]
exactly friends ten years ago, but you[A][NL]
have to be realistic. People are dying. You[NL]
stopped Kilthel to prevent that. Are you[A][NL]
seriously just going to sit here and pretend[NL]
it's any different? So what if it happens[A][NL]
all at once or over the course of one hundred[NL]
years? It's a lot of death either way.[A]
[FarLeft]Kendrick... You really aren't the marauding[NL]
pirate you were ten years ago, are you?[A]
[FarRight]Pirate!?[A]
[Right]Honest.[....] Businessman.[A]
[FarLeft]Hahah! Still have a bit of a sense of humor[NL]
though. In all seriousness, I would love[A][NL]
to help you, Adlez, but I don't think I can.[A]
[Left]Talk to your friends.[A]
[FarLeft]Excuse me?[A]
[Left]You said you had help when[NL]
you stopped Kilthel, right?[A]
[FarLeft]Well... Of course.[NL]
There were many of us.[A]
[Left]You hinted that some of them hold noteworthy[NL]
positions in Avenir. Do they?[A]
[FarLeft]Ye-es...[A]
[Left]So talk to them. If not that, meet them on[NL]
the battlefield. They know you wouldn't[A][NL]
show yourself unless it truly meant[A][NL]
something. Seeing you fighting to stop them[NL]
would certainly rouse them, right?[A]
[FarRight][Tact], are you saying we meet[NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae in battle?[A][Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
That's exactly what I'm saying. On[NL]
the border. We're all strong[A][NL]
fighters, we can fend for ourselves.[A]
[FarLeft]You might have an idea there, [Tact]...[NL]
Very well. Allow me to organize myself. I[A][NL]
advise all of you to do the same. Tomorrow,[NL]
we move south, towards the border of Arcanae[NL]
and Cesaria. I imagine there are often[A][NL]
skirmishes there. If we find ourselves in the[NL]
middle of one, its the chance we need.[A]
[FarRight]Are you sure about this?[A]
[FarLeft]I had forgotten myself. I apologize. Peace[NL]
is more necessary than my vow to retreat[A][NL]
from Avenir's affairs. Thank you all. I will[NL]
see you tomorrow when we move out.[A][X]
