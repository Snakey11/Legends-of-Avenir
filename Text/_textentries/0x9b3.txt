He's...[....] Dead. He had no quarrel with us.[A]
[Right]Luke, I understand this journey has been hard[NL]
on you. I know you don't like violence.[A]
[FarLeft]No. I want to see this through. If[NL]
this is the will of the Higher Beings...[A]
[Left]The Higher Beings don't hold power. The[NL]
Guardian Spirit does. He influences Inge[A][NL]
and Vene, and the events of the world. The[NL]
Higher Beings are just his puppets.[A]
[FarLeft]How would you know?[A]
[Left]We have a history on it in Arcanae.[NL]
It's required reading for magic school.[A]
[FarRight]Yes. I've read it too.[A]
[FarLeft]So you say I've been living of a lie.[A]
[Right]We can't worry about that now Luke.[NL]
If you want to go, I won't fault you,[A][NL]
but now's your chance.[A]
[FarLeft]That would make our friendship a lie[NL]
too. No.[.....] I will see this through.[A]
[Right][Smile]I'm glad. So where to next, Val?[A][Smile]
[Left]We can start moving towards the capital. Lord[NL]
Uzkalis instructed me to head there[A][NL]
immediately if we encountered[NL]
Cesarian resistance.[A]
[FarRight]I spent a long time studying[NL]
Cesarian maps. I can lead the way.[A]
[Right]Thank you, both. Let's move out. The sooner[NL]
we end this, the sooner we can go home.[A]
[FarLeft]That's an idea we can get behind. Thank[NL]
you, [Tact]. And to you two as well.[A][NL]
I don't know how long I would[NL]
have gone on living a lie.[A]
[Left]Luke... I'm sorry. I was a little harsh.[NL]
It's not a lie. The Higher Beings[A][NL]
still exist in the outer lands.[A]
[Right]The islands that surround Avenir?[A]
[Left]Correct. They await a time[NL]
they are needed here.[A]
[FarLeft]We can't turn to them[NL]
to solve our problems.[A]
[Right]Lead the way to the capital, Helmer. No[NL]
point in toiling around here any longer.[A]
[FarRight]Understood, [Tact].[A][X]
