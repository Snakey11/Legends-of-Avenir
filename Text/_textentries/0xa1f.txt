Basileus Leon, is it?[A]
[MidLeft]You're the freelancer, eh?[NL]
You all did very well out there.[A]
[FarRight]What?[A]
[MidLeft]I was testing you. When I received word[NL]
bandit clan's true aspirations were, I[A][NL]
must admit, I was intrigued. I'm sick of[NL]
the war between Arcanae and Cesaria as much[A][NL]
as anyone. It has brought Haedric economic[NL]
prosperity, yes, but we are also constantly[A][NL]
being dragged one way or another.[A]
[Right]You had us cut through some of your[NL]
toughest soldiers to prove ourselves?[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Toughest soldiers? Please, if I had[NL]
wanted that, you would have been facing[A][NL]
the Warlords. These men were far from[NL]
illustrious Haedrician soldiers. In fact,[A][NL]
many of them were criminals and former[NL]
bandits themselves. Useless trash.[A]
[Right]I can't decide if aligning with[NL]
you will be a good or bad idea...[A]
[MidLeft]The only reason I have to align with[NL]
you all is the artifact. If I[A][NL]
wanted you dead, you would be.[A]
[FarRight]He makes a fair point. Besides, he[NL]
has no reason to have waited to talk[A][NL]
to us if he wanted to backstab us.[A]
[Right]Right. Adlez? What do you[NL]
think? So we'll trust him?[A]
[FarRight]Yes. We'll trust him.[A]
[Right]Good. So... What now?[A]
[MidLeft]We clean up the castle. After that[NL]
and a rest, we can meet to discuss where[A][NL]
we go from here. [Tact], Adlez, I'd[NL]
like you both to participate.[A]
[Right]Arya and Vicar too.[A]
[MidLeft]Very well, then. But first,[NL]
clean up my castle.[A]
[Right]The test was your idea, why[NL]
should we clean up the mess?[A]
[MidLeft]I'll help, don't worry. I'm[NL]
not always one to leave[A][NL]
my dirty work to others.[A][X]
