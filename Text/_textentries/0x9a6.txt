Nonsense. Cesaria holds the right to that[NL]
treasure. We received a missive from[A][NL]
Adlez' right hand man, Connor,[NL]
and came right away.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]Captain Maximus of the Tiger Brigade.[A][NL]
What a surprise this is...[A]
[FarLeft]I do not intend to fight you[NL]
here, Uzkalis. I came here[A][NL]
on business, nothing more.[A]
[Right]With all due respect to both of you, I[NL]
still hold the artifact. We also stand[A][NL]
on Haedrician soil, so neither of you[NL]
hold jurisdiction in the first place.[A]
[FarLeft]I really wouldn't call this[NL]
stuff soil if we're being honest here...[A][NL]
But Cesaria is a closer ally of[NL]
Haedric than Arcanae is.[A]
[FarRight]Only because of the fundamental difference[NL]
in philosophy between the[A][NL]
physical and the magical.[A]
[FarLeft]Even so, it is true. Freelancer,[NL]
I missed your name.[A]
[Right][Tact].[A]
[FarLeft]Well, [Tact], allow me to tell you that[NL]
Uzkalis and Xavus only recognize one thing.[A][NL]
Power. If you have any character at all,[NL]
you'll allow me to pay you for that[A][NL]
artifact. I can also arrange for your[NL]
protection from any counterattack[A][NL]
you may face from Arcanae.[A]
[FarRight]I can assure you the same protection from[NL]
our side. It's a known fact that all[A][NL]
Cesaria desires is land and power.[NL]
They're the real villains here.[A][X]
