We did it... They're both withdrawing.[A]
[MidRight]So what now?[A]
[Left]We've finished. I intend to act as a mediator[NL]
for peace talks... It's the only way we'll[A][NL]
get the two sides to listen to each other.[A]
[FarLeft]A worthy cause. We'll be taking our leave[NL]
of you. Negotiations aren't really my thing,[A][NL]
and there's much mercenary work to be done.[A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][Smile][LoadWalter]
It has been an honor, Efil.[A][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
Thank you for showing us that violence[NL]
is not the answer to everything.[A]
[Left]Vicar, Walter, Baret... Thank you for helping[NL]
me. I could not have done it without you.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]
It's my time to take my leave as[NL]
well. Lots of business to take[A][NL]
advantage of as soon as the trade[NL]
routes open again. Speaking of[A][NL]
which, Vicar, would[Smile] you three[NL]
like to be my caravan guards?[A][NL]
I'll pay you well.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]Walter? Baret?[A][CloseSpeech][Right][LoadBaret]
Steady work? Sure. Why not?[NL]
So long as I get paid.[A]
[FarLeft]It's a deal, Kendrick.[A]
[FarRight]Good, good! I'll call on[NL]
you when I need you.[A][ClearFace][LoadArya][Right][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
I'll be heading back to Shizon. It's[NL]
been an honor to fight alongside you all.[A]
[Left]Tell Xexim that it's over,[NL]
Arya. There will be peace.[A]
[FarRight]I will. Thank you.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadAdlez]
I suppose I'd better return to Haedric.[A]
[Right]Adlez! You're wanted there! They'll[NL]
imprison you for sure... Or worse![A]
[FarLeft]I know. And I'll pay for my crimes. We[NL]
all do sooner or later. I saw my dream[A][NL]
fulfilled, though, and that's more than many[NL]
people can say about their lives. Thank[A][NL]
you, [Tact], and thank you, Efil. You've[NL]
treated this grizzled bandit far better[A][NL]
than he ever could have asked for.[A]
[Right]It's been my honor, friend. Good luck...[A]
[Left]What about you, [Tact]?[NL]
What will you do?[A]
[Right]I don't know. I guess I'll[NL]
resume my freelance work.[A]
[Left]That is understandable. I wish you luck.[NL]
If you ever find yourself out in[A][NL]
Draterus, feel free to call on me.[A]
[Right]Ha! I will. Thank you, Efil.[A][X]
