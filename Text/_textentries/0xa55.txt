Captain![A]
[MidLeft]Lieutenant! What is it?[A]
[MidRight]A force from the north is attacking.[NL]
We managed to identify one of them[A][NL]
as someone who look remarkably[NL]
similar to the Hero Efil.[A]
[MidLeft]Efil? No... It can't be. But if it is... I[NL]
cannot give him what he wants. Do not show[A][NL]
leniency in your attack. If they do not[A][NL]
stand with us, they stand against us.[A]
[MidRight]Sir?[A]
[MidLeft]I don't have the authority to negotiate[NL]
here. I hope Efil is able to understand that.[A][NL]
Inform the troops to start moving on him, but[NL]
then I need you to return to the capital.[A]
[MidRight]Why?[A]
[MidLeft]I need you to secure approval from[NL]
General Rex and the Emperor to[A][NL]
negotiate Tell them Efil is intervening.[A]
[MidRight]What about you?[A]
[MidLeft]I... have to hold Xavus off and hope this[NL]
ends well. Tell the men before you go to[A][NL]
hold their defensive positions against[NL]
Arcanae. But...[....] No. Avoid engaging with[A][NL]
Efil if possible. Good luck, Lux.[A]
[MidRight]Captain...[.....] Thank you, Maximus.[NL]
Good luck to you as well.[A][X]
