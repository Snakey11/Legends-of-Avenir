You're a good person, [Tact]. I'll give[NL]
you the agreed payment for the artifact.[A]
[FarRight]Dammit... Let's go, men. We'll have to[NL]
set out into the desert to find more[A][NL]
artifacts. Xavus would be displeased if we[NL]
returned empty handed...[....][A][NL]
We'll meet again, [Tact].[A][ClearFace][Right][LoadArc][FarLeft]
First thing's first, I'll pay you for the[NL]
artifact. We had arranged a payment of[A][NL]
12,000 gold to Adlez and his[NL]
men. Will that suffice?[A]
[Right]That's... fine.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][Right][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
[Smile]Thank you, Captain.[A]
[FarLeft]Please, just call me Maximus.[A]
[Right]So that's that. Our deal[NL]
is arranged. I'm ready to head on home.[A]
[FarLeft]Wait just a moment. I have[NL]
another offer for you all.[A]
[Left]I'm listening.[A]
[FarLeft]Frankly, the war with Uzkalis and Xavus[NL]
'New Arcanae' isn't going as well as[A][NL]
we would hope. Cesaria's forces[NL]
are spread thin.[A]
[Left]You want our help?[A][FarRight][LoadFinoc]
[FarLeft]Yes. Only if you all agree, though.[A]
[FarRight]Elanil and I will have to report to the[NL]
Anguis and High Priest Izuk first.[A][NL]
We'd love to help, but right now,[NL]
we have our own duty to perform.[A]
[FarLeft]I understand.[A]
[Right][Smile]May you face clear skies.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]An old Altian salute... Thank you,[NL]
[Tact]. We'll remember this.[A][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]What about the rest of you?[A]
[FarRight][LoadLuke]There's nothing for me[NL]
back in Danaan. I'd rather travel and[A][NL]
continue learning about other cultures[NL]
and meeting new people.[A]
[Left]I don't share the same sentiment.[NL]
Danaan is my home. I'd rather not[A][NL]
just leave it to gallop off into a war.[A]
[Right]I understand. It's been an[NL]
honor travelling with you, Arc.[A]
[Left]Likewise.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]I may actually have some information[NL]
for you. You said Danaan, correct?[A]
[Left]Aye...?[A][Right][Smile]
[FarLeft]I have members of the Cheetah Brigade[NL]
reporting to me around the clock,[A][NL]
including scouts in Haedric on the off[NL]
chance Basileus Leon caught on to[A][NL]
something. I recently received word that[NL]
two of them had perished attempting[A][NL]
to fend off a bandit attack on a town[NL]
called Danaan. Danaan...[.....][A][NL]
It was burned to the ground.[A]
[Left][ClearFace][LoadArc]What!? No! Did some of Adlez'[NL]
men somehow slip past us?[A]
[FarRight]They must have...[A]
[Left]Dammit... I was a fool...[A]
[Right]Arc, you can't blame yourself.[NL]
I should've known all three[A][NL]
of us going after[NL]
Gerwick was a mistake...[A]
[Left]It doesn't matter now. I need[NL]
some time to myself. Let me know[A][NL]
when we set out. I'll be there.[A][ClearFace]
[Right]Arc...[A]
[FarRight]Let him be, [Tact]. He felt[NL]
a stronger sense of duty towards[A][NL]
Danaan than anybody else. With the[NL]
town burned to the ground... He's[A][NL]
lost his purpose. Let him figure[NL]
this one out himself.[A]
[FarLeft]I'm sorry to have[NL]
brought this news...[A]
[Right]I'd rather he find out now than[NL]
get there and see the wreckage...[A]
[FarLeft]You all deserve some rest. We'll[NL]
talk more tomorrow about what to[A][NL]
do about Uzkalis. Navigating and[NL]
moving in the desert is a slow[A][NL]
process, he's likely not going[NL]
anywhere anytime soon.[A]
[Right]I understand. Thank you, Maximus.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]No, [Tact], thank you.[NL]
You made a good choice today.[A]
[Right]I sure hope so...[A][X]
