[MidRight][LoadPlayer]
Work's all but dried up recently...[NL]
I need to find something. Soon.[A]
[Pause]
[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]
Has it really? That's a real shame.[A]
[MidRight]Wha- Where did you come from?[A]
[MidLeft]Oh, I've always been here.[NL]
Watching. Listening. You've put[A][NL]
on quite the good show, [Tact].[A]
[MidRight]I don't understand what[NL]
you're saying. Who are you?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't know? Or, more appropriately,[NL]
you don't remember? I'm the one[A][NL]
that gave you this life, lost soul.[A]
[MidRight]Wait... I do have a[NL]
vague recollection...[A]
[MidLeft]Must I spell it out for you? I[A] A-M[A][NL]
T-H-E[A] G-U-A-R-D-I-A-N[A] S-P-I-R-I-T.[A]
[MidRight]The Guardian Spirit... Kilthel?[A]
[MidLeft]Nonono, Efil destroyed him ten years ago.[NL]
I'm Kilthel's replacement.[A][NL]
We're pretty slow today, no?[A]
[MidRight]So why are you here aside[NL]
from playing with me?[A]
[MidLeft]Play with you? You really have it figured[NL]
out, don't you? Alas, all toys must come to[A][NL]
an end. You see, it goes against my oath as[NL]
Guardian Spirit to impact the events of[A][NL]
the world, and unfortunately, you've caused[NL]
me to break that oath. So here's the[A][NL]
deal. I kill you. Then, I roll time back[NL]
to before you were ever given this[NL]
new life.[A]
[MidRight]Wait a minute![A]
[MidLeft]No.[A][X]
