[MidRight][LoadKendrick][Left][LoadPlayer]So who are you really, Kendrick?[NL]
I mean, what do you normally deal?[A]
[MidRight]Just a businessman. I handle a lot[NL]
of different trade. My men are tough too,[A][NL]
so sometimes we take mercenary jobs.[....][NL]
I keep my work honest, though...[....][NL]
so long as its proffitable.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke]As long as it's profitable? That[NL]
doesn't sound like honest work to me.[A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadArc]
Mercenary merchant? You act more like[NL]
a pirate than a merchant.[A]
[Right][Smile]What's the difference? Haha![A][CloseSpeech][.......][....]
[TMM]...[.....][TMM] [Smile]I don't expect a monk[NL]
like you to understand.[A]
[FarLeft]My name is Luke.[A]
[FarRight]Don't bother, Luke. He may claim to be honest,[NL]
but all these merchants are the same.[A]
[Right]As are Haedrician warriors. Let me[NL]
guess...[....] You're only here because[A][NL]
of a thirst for adventure?[A]
[FarRight][LoadArc]You know nothing of me.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArya]Arc, Luke, calm down. He's[NL]
just trying to rile you up.[A]
[Right]My bad, friends. I suppose not all of[NL]
you are used to the culture here at sea.[A]
[FarRight]Kendrick, there's another[NL]
ship over there.[A]
[Events]
[Right]What? Impossible.[A]
[Left]I see it too.[A]
[Right]I have eyes. Let me see...[NL]
Damn. Sure enough.[A]
[Left]Who are they?[A]
[FarLeft]They don't look quite so...[NL]
refined as this ship does.[A]
[Right]I know that boat... Damn. Thought I got[NL]
rid of them awhile ago. I hate to ask[A][NL]
you, but mind helping me out with this?[A]
[Left]With what...?[A]
[Events]
[Right]Just look at the flag.[NL]
Those aren't just any pirates.[A]
[FarRight]That flag...[....] I've seen it before...[.][NL]
The Dread Reapers' pirate crew?[A]
[FarLeft]They...[....] They kill in the[NL]
name of the demon Altorosk...[A]
[Right]It's a load of bull. I would know.[A]
[FarLeft]What?[A]
[Right]I used to be their captain...[NL]
'til I abandoned them in Altia.[A][NL]
They didn't appreciate that.[A]
[FarRight]You were a pirate!?[A]
[Right]And now I'm an honest businessman![NL]
Do me a favor and help me[A][NL]
get rid of these buffoons. I don't[NL]
think we can outrun them[A]
[Left]I'd be glad to.[A][X]
