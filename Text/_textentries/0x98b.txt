[FarLeft][LoadArya][Right][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadXexim]We made it... [Tact],[NL]
[Smile]I thank you for your help.[A]
[Right][Smile]It has been my honor.[A]
[Left]I would be pleased for you to return to[NL]
Shizon with me. You would be a more[A][NL]
than worthy addition to our order.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArya]I would agree.[Smile] You are[NL]
a skilled warrior [Tact][A]
[Right]Arya... Thank you.[A]
[Left]What of the rest of you?[A]
[FarRight][LoadLuke]You provided me a very unique opportunity[NL]
to come to a greater understanding of[A][NL]
who the Higher Beings truly are. For that,[NL]
I thank you, but I don't believe[A][NL]
I can live in Shizon.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadArc]Danaan has been going downhill the past[NL]
few years. Luke and I think that we[A][NL]
can possibly make a difference in the town's[NL]
future if we use all that we have[A][NL]
learned on this trip.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]I too, will aid with Danaan. This[NL]
is an opportunity to expand my[A][NL]
business. Don't worry, I'll keep in touch[NL]
with Shizon. A businessman never[A][NL]
turns his back on patrons.[A]
[Left]I'm glad to see you all know what[NL]
you must do. May we all[A][NL]
meet again in the future.[A][X]
