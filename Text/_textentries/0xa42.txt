Ah, you're here! I have all the supplies we[NL]
should need for our excursion ready.[A][NL]
Whenever you're ready to head into[NL]
Draterus, we should be good.[A]
[Left]I think we're ready. Any objections?[A]
[FarLeft]None from me.[A][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
We're all ready.[A]
[MidRight]Very well. You said Temple of Kilthel[NL]
was your destination, right?[A][NL]
Interesting...[.....] Nobody's set[NL]
foot there for ten years.[A]
[Left]You want to know our goal?[A]
[MidRight]No, I'm just contemplating what[NL]
treasures we may be able to find.[A][NL]
Might as well get going, not much[NL]
reason to stick around here.[A]
[Left]Understandable. We're all[NL]
ready. Lead the way, Kendrick.[A]
[MidRight]My pleasure.[A][X]
