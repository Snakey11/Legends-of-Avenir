[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadLuke][FarRight][LoadArc]Looks like they saw us coming.[A]
[MidLeft]They have strength in numbers. If[NL]
only we could split their forces...[A]
[FarRight]I wouldn't plan on it. We should be[NL]
able to draw them in and strike though.[A]
[Right]Moving forward, but defensively...[NL]
A simple strategy, but effective.[A]
[MidLeft]I want to get this done quickly. There's[NL]
a good chance some of them are trying to[A][NL]
escape to go back after Danaan with[NL]
our attention diverted here.[A]
[FarRight]You didn't count on that before!?[A]
[MidLeft]I didn't expect to be seen so soon.[NL]
Don't worry, you shouldn't have[A][NL]
anything to worry about.[A]
[FarRight]Says you! They'll destroy my home![A]
[Right]They're coming...[A][X]
