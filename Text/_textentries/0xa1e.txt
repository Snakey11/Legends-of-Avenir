None of this makes sense...[A]
[MidRight]What do you mean?[A]
[MidLeft]Leon knows this isn't all of us.[NL]
There's no reason to lure us[A][NL]
here if it wouldn't ensure the[NL]
total destruction of the clan.[A]
[MidRight]What are you suggesting?[A]
[MidLeft]Don't kill Leon when we reach him. Speak to him.[NL]
There's more here than meets the eye.[A]
[MidRight]I see what you're saying...[NL]
Let's hope we can get to him[A][NL]
in the first place, though.[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadAdlez]
Less talking, more fighting![NL]
We can't fall here![A][X]
