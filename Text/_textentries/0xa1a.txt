[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadWalter]
Hey, [Tact].[A]
[MidLeft]Walter, are you guys sticking with us?[A]
[MidRight]Looks that way. I don't quite know[NL]
Vicar's reasoning to be honest...[A]
[MidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[MidRight]He's always wanted to escape from all this.[NL]
To see him diving in at the forefront of a[A][NL]
movement that will only prolong the war...[NL]
It's odd. But I trust him, as does Baret.[A]
[MidLeft]You're all very close, aren't you?[A]
[MidRight]Yeah. Baret and I were left on our[NL]
own when we were younger and Vicar[A][NL]
took us in. Taught us how to fight. Soon[NL]
enough, we were a small mercenary group[A][NL]
taking odd jobs here and there. Never[NL]
thought we'd end up as bandits though.[A]
[MidLeft]I feel you. Who can argue, though? It's good[NL]
pay, a fairly stable line of work if[A][NL]
you're smart about it, not to mention[NL]
we've got this whole plot brewing.[A]
[MidRight]Vicar puts faith in you, [Tact]. My[NL]
brother is willing to roll with whatever,[A][NL]
so long as he gets to fight. I just[NL]
hope we're on the right path.[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadAdlez]
We received word from the Basileus.[NL]
He wants us to set out for the[A][NL]
capital to meet with us immediately.[A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveFarRight][Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Don't you fear a trap?[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Of course I do. If it were anyone but[NL]
Leon, I'd have more suspicions. I have[A][NL]
a lot of confidence in our ability.[A]
[Right]So what do you plan to do[NL]
in case there is a trap?[A]
[MidLeft]Just a few of us are gonna go. A large[NL]
brunt of the clan will stay back here. If[A][NL]
they don't receive word from us within a[NL]
day of us leaving, they are to scatter.[A]
[FarRight]You just intend to charge straight in?[NL]
The men we'll be fighting serve the[A][NL]
Basileus, they'll be quite a few steps[NL]
above what we're used to. You're putting[A][NL]
an awful lot of faith in our skills.[A]
[MidLeft]We defeated Tyrone, did we not? That's[NL]
why I intend to leave most of the men[A][NL]
behind. Walter, can you talk to Vicar and[NL]
Baret? I value their skills immensely, and[A][NL]
would like both of them to accompany us.[A]
[FarRight]Of course. I'm on it.[A][ClearFace][Right]
Who else do you intend to bring?[A]
[MidLeft]Me, you, Arya, Connor. I don't trust[NL]
leaving Connor here in command. Arya[A][NL]
wants to see how this plays out. And I trust[NL]
you. I want a group of people I trust[A][NL]
to think for themselves. If it is a[NL]
trap, we all need to be on edge...[A]
[Right]Adlez, are you sure about[NL]
this? This is a huge risk.[A]
[MidLeft]It's one we have to take. We're[NL]
stuck here, otherwise. We've already[A][NL]
reached out to Leon. If we don't go to[NL]
meet with him, he'll surely send men[A][NL]
here to deal with us. Our options are[NL]
take the risk, or let our idea for a[A][NL]
bandit empire crumble to the ground.[A]
[Right]I understand where you're coming[NL]
from. Besides, this way, you're only[A][NL]
risking a few of us. Plus you aren't[NL]
forcing any of us to go along anyway.[A]
[MidLeft]Well, besides Connor. I trust[NL]
that man about about as much[A][NL]
as I'd trust an Arcanian.[A]
[Right]Ha! He certainly seems[NL]
like a piece of work.[A]
[MidLeft]He is, but his [Smile]immorality to the[NL]
rest of our crew. I'll go fetch them, you[A][NL]
finish whatever preparations you need[NL]
to make. I'm relying on you, [Tact].[A]
[Right]I won't let you down.[A][X]
