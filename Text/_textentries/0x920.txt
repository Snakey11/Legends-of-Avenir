[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]Gotcha.[....] From here,[.] you'll select which[NL]
lifestyle you wish to follow. Each has[A][NL]
different classes you can choose; each[NL]
has different paths to follow. Mercenary[A][NL]
paths tend to have less units, but will[NL]
likely give you a higher understanding[A][NL]
of the lore of the world we inhabit,[NL]
Avenir. The Military paths will give[A][NL]
you more units at the cost of having[NL]
the luxury of getting to know each of[A][NL]
them well. The Mage path takes a middle[NL]
ground of these paths,[.] but may prove[A][NL]
difficult due to your personal inability[NL]
to fight well at close range.[A][NL]
Which will it be?[A][X]
