[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadMerchant][Smile]Thanks again for your help![....] Once[NL]
I'm across the border, some of Haedric's[A][NL]
troops should be able to escort me[NL]
the rest of the way to Danaan.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]You're very welcome.[Smile][.....] Be careful on the[NL]
Rosk Highway,[.] though.[.....] There's tension[A][NL]
there between Haedric and Arcanae.[A][NL]
[MidRight]I'll keep that in mind.[....] Here's half of[NL]
your payment for now,[.] and I'll make[A][NL]
arrangements for you to be paid in full[NL]
later.[....] Will that suffice?[A][NL]
[MidLeft][Smile]That'll be fine.[......] Bacrun merchants[NL]
always keep their word.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Farewell,[.] and may we meet again.[A][X]
