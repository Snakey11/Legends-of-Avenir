Who goes there?[A]
[MidLeft]It's just me, [Tact].[NL]
Your old friend.[A]
[MidRight]I don't know who you are.[A]
[MidLeft]Really, lost soul? You have no idea?[A]
[Events]
[MidRight]Wait...[....] I remember now... [....]You're...[....][NL]
The Guardian Spirit! The successor to[NL]
Kilthel, but...[....] why are you here?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't recall? I'm the one who[NL]
gave you this life. I started you[A][NL]
as a freelancer back in Haedric.[A]
[MidRight]I remember now! You caused all of this?[A]
[MidLeft]In a way. By creating you, I did. But...[NL]
there is one problem. You've caused far[A][NL]
too much. The oath that gives me the power[NL]
of the Guardian Spirit prevents me from[A][NL]
directly intervening in the affairs of the[NL]
world. Aside from that, the death of Xexim[A][NL]
is particularly troubling... For that[NL]
reason... I must kill you, then roll time[A][NL]
back. Don't take too much offense...[NL]
I'm sure I'll give you this[A][NL]
opportunity again, lost soul.[A]
[MidRight]Dammit, no![A][X]
