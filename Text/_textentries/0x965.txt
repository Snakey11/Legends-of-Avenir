[FarRight][LoadKendrick][Smile]My oh my,[.] if it isn't Arya![A]
[FarLeft][LoadArya]Kendrick![A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight][Smile]There you are.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left][LoadArc]Who's this ruffian?[A]
[FarRight]The name's Kendrick. I'm a businessman, and[NL]
also a skilled skipper. I'm one of the few people[NL]
who knows a safe route to Shizon outside[A][NL]
of Cesaria and Arcanae's navies.[A]
[FarLeft]That sounds...[.....] awfully handy.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]Do you not trust me, monk?[A]
[FarLeft]No, I do.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadPlayer]Calm down, Luke. What's[NL]
the catch, Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight]No catch. It's part of my business deal[NL]
with Xexim, Lord of Shizon, to escort[A][NL]
any Shizonians to and from the island.[NL]
You're all friends of Arya here,[A][Smile][NL]
so I'm sure it'll work out.[A]
[Left]Isn't Shizon strict about visitors?[A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadArya]That's more just a rumor than anything else.[NL]
We distrust visitors, but if you can[A][NL]
find someone willing and able to take[NL]
you there, you can visit at your leisure.[A]
[FarRight]Anyway we've got everyone, so[NL]
we may as well get going.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]What's the hurry?[A]
[FarRight][Smile]This isn't a place you want to stick around[NL]
for long in, monk.[.] Port Selsing is[A][NL]
the wart of Arcanae.[.] I'm surprised[NL]
they still let it exist.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]How do you mean?[A]
[FarRight]I'm an honest businessman, but some[NL]
businessmen aren't so honest. They run their[A][NL]
smuggling operations out of this port. You'd[NL]
rather not get caught up with them,[A][NL]
trust me...[Smile] unless you'd enjoy[NL]
being sold on a slave market.[A]
[FarLeft]You know, I think[NL]
I'd pass on that.[A]
[Left][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Why does the Arcanian government[NL]
do nothing about them?[A]
[FarRight]The Arcanian government is inefficient,[NL]
especially with the war going on. The Five[A][NL]
Grand Magi constantly squabbling brings[A][NL]
actual progress to a halt. It's better for[NL]
all of us that we just set out for Shizon[A][NL]
immediately. Trust me. Arcanae has those[NL]
officials like who we saw, but they're[A][NL]
as corrupt as everyone else here.[A]
[Right]I agree with Kendrick.[A]
[FarLeft]You two both know better[NL]
than us. Let's set sail.[A][X]
