[MidRight][LoadRex][MidLeft][LoadPlayer]
I know you're loyal to your Emperor.[A]
[MidRight]Then you know I won't tell you anything.[NL]
Saving my life makes no difference.[A][NL]
I would have rather you killed me...[A]
[MidLeft]I'm guessing some written indication of your[NL]
orders was left here. Elanil will find out.[A]
[MidRight]The Altian? Ha...[A]
[MidLeft]This is your only chance, Rex.[NL]
You'll save us time.[A]
[MidRight]But I'll buy my Emperor the time. That[NL]
makes it all worthwhile. You're [Tact],[A][NL]
aren't you? Maximus mentioned you.[A]
[MidLeft]I chose Arcanae. Not Cesaria.[NL]
I stand by that.[A]
[MidRight]Then we have nothing to discuss. I am[NL]
loyal to my Emperor. I would have[A][NL]
died... No, I WILL die for him![A][X]
