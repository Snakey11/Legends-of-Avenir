[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadArc]All we have to do is hold off.[....] Gerwick[NL]
doesn't like to stay in one place for[A][NL]
very long.[......] He knows he can't stand up to a[NL]
force much more formidable than us.[A][NL]
If you kill him now, it will do the town[NL]
good, but don't risk your life for it.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Got it. Will it just be us two?[A][NL]
[MidRight]I don't really know. A lot of them are[NL]
woodsmen. I bet the rest are far out. The[A][NL]
only one who I know is in town is Luke, a[NL]
monk. He's probably tending to the church.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Let's see if we can meet up with him.[NL]
The more men we have,[.] the better.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Got it.[....] If we stick together,[NL]
we should make it out of this alive![A][X]
