[FarLeft][LoadKendrick][Left][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadLuke][Right][LoadArc]What do we do with the ship?[A]
[FarLeft]Take the loot and start tearing[NL]
it apart. I'll be damned if I[A][NL]
ever have to see this ship again.[A]
[FarRight]But...[....] They were your[NL]
friends, were they not?[A]
[FarLeft]There are no friends in the pirate[NL]
business, monk. Only allies, and[A][NL]
sometimes allegiances change. The same[NL]
runs true for us in the normal[A][NL]
business. Don't worry, though, you[NL]
all count as allies... for now.[A]
[Left]Kendrick.[A]
[FarLeft]Don't worry about it, Arya.[NL]
At least I'm glad to be rid of 'em.[A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]Kendrick's... strangeness aside,[NL]
how far to Shizon?[A]
[FarLeft]We should be getting close.[.] Don't fret.[A]
[FarRight]No friends...[....] Only allies...[....][NL]
This really is a cruel world.[A][CloseSpeech][Right][ClearFace][FarRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadArc]
You're overthinking it, Luke.[NL]
Just do what you believe in.[A]
[Right][MoveLeft][Right][ClearFace][LoadArya][Left][ClearFace][LoadLuke]But what do I believe in? Everything[NL]
I've thought has been proven wrong[A][NL]
on this journey. I just[NL]
don't understand any of this.[A]
[Right]The world is a cruel one, Luke.[NL]
People like you are few and far between[A][NL]
who cling to the old writings of the[NL]
Higher Beings. Believe me,[A][NL]
all will be revealed in Shizon.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]Shizon... Land of the Assassins...[NL]
What do the Higher Beings[A][NL]
have to do with it, Arya?[A]
[Right]You'll understand.[NL]
Do not worry, [Tact].[A]
[FarLeft]There it is, on the horizon.[NL]
We'll be there soon.[A][X]
