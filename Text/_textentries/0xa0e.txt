This is Yerchek?[A]
[FarRight]Yes. I'm sure both their mayor and[NL]
Warlord Tyrone will be in battle today.[A]
[MidLeft]So it'll be tougher than any[NL]
fight we've done so far.[A]
[FarRight]Hence why I intend to join you. Connor[NL]
is back at the hideout organizing other[A][NL]
men for where we go after this.[NL]
He can't interfere today.[A]
[MidLeft]I see... [Tact], this is a tricky battle[NL]
we fight today. We have all agreed to[A][NL]
place our trust in you. The artifact is[NL]
the goal, Tyrone likely defends the home[A][NL]
where they keep it. Senseless killing is[NL]
not necessarily our goal today, but if[A][NL]
you feel that Connor's methods are the[NL]
way we must resolve this dispute,[A][NL]
we will not stand in your way.[A]
[FarRight]I agree. You are levelheaded, [Tact].[A]
[Right]Thank you, both. I will do my best.[A][MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadArya]
Cut the chatter and focus. It looks[NL]
like the Haedricians are coming.[A][ClearFace][FarLeft][LoadSoldier2]
You there! We're on high security![NL]
State your name and business![A]
[Right]My name is [Tact]. We're here[NL]
to raid your wonderful little town.[A]
[FarLeft]Ha! Warlord Tyrone thought you[NL]
might be coming... To arms![A][NL]
We fight 'til our last breath![A][X]
