[MidRight][LoadRex][MidLeft][LoadSoldier4]General Rex, we will stand[NL]
by you and fight. We of the Dragon[A][NL]
Brigade will face no opposition![A]
[MidRight]Thank you. Perhaps attacking[NL]
Shizon was wrong...[A]
[MidLeft]Sir?[A]
[MidRight]I believed that by destroying Shizon,[NL]
we could put an end to their habit of[A][NL]
being hired out both for us and against us.[NL]
A neutral country that isn't[A][NL]
truly neutral cannot exist.[A]
[MidLeft]You believed they were only[NL]
furthering the war?[A]
[MidRight]Yes. And their damned devotion to[NL]
those Higher Beings they love so much[A][NL]
clings to the past... Either we win here[NL]
today and the future is changed,[A][NL]
or I face the repercussions[NL]
for my actions.[A]
[MidLeft]We enlisted for a better future.[NL]
We will die to see that happen.[A][ClearFace][......]
[MidRight]Men of the Dragon Brigade! Today, we[NL]
fight to see a brighter future for[A][NL]
Cesaria, and all of Avenir! Assassins of[NL]
Shizon have invaded the castle! See[A][NL]
to it that the wart upon[NL]
Avenir is expunged![A][X]
