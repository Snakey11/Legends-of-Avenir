[FarRight][LoadLuke]Hey guys... *huff* Arya[NL]
sent me. She believes the other force[A][NL]
is a diversion to split us apart.[A]
[Left][LoadKendrick][FarLeft][LoadPlayer]Who the hell is Xexim that they[NL]
want him dead so badly?[A]
[Left]Cesaria have never been overly fond of[NL]
the cult-like nature of Shizon. Between[A][NL]
that disagreement and the fact that Shizon[NL]
doesn't exactly help them in this war,[A][NL]
it makes sense. It's probably more[NL]
about Shizon and less about Xexim.[A]
That would make sense, but we don't really[NL]
have time. More Cesarians incoming![A][X]
