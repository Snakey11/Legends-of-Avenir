[FarRight][LoadLeon][Right][LoadAdlez][Left][LoadVicar][FarLeft][LoadPlayer]
Took you two long enough.[A]
[Left]It's fine, Adlez. Now that we're all here,[NL]
we should be able to begin? Leon?[A]
[FarRight]Yes. Just so we all understand, our goal[NL]
is to eradicate both Cesaria and Arcanae,[A][NL]
without taking a side in the war. Correct?[A]
[Right]Yes.[A]
[FarRight]Good. Now, I believe the linchpin[NL]
in this conflict is Bacrun...[A]
[FarLeft]Wouldn't it make sense to take the[NL]
two countries on one at a time? I[A][NL]
trust in the individual strength of[NL]
Haedrician warriors, but there's[A][NL]
fewer of them than in either Cesaria[NL]
or Arcanae's militaries, not to[A][NL]
mention the lack of organization.[A]
[FarRight]If we were to attack Cesaria,[NL]
Arcanae would think we were siding[A][NL]
with them. The opposite holds[NL]
true if we attack Arcanae. The[A][NL]
only way to remain neutral to[NL]
either side is to attack the[A][NL]
city they both rely heavily on.[A]
[FarLeft]I suppose that makes sense.[A]
[Left]So Bacrun, eh? The merchants' hub?[A]
[FarRight]Correct. It is an indispensable asset[NL]
to both countries. They may be at war[A][NL]
with each other, but the merchants[NL]
travelling to and from Bacrun keep both[A][NL]
their armies supplied with resources. If[NL]
we cut off that supply, we antagonize[A][NL]
both Arcanae and Cesaria, turning[NL]
their attention towards us[A][NL]
rather than each other.[A]
[FarLeft]The issue is that they then both after[NL]
us. We're strong, but I don't fancy[A][NL]
standing up to two superpowers with nothing[NL]
but a horde of bandits and Haedricians.[A]
[FarRight]You forget, we have the artifact. It[NL]
can summon Vathrylian guardians to aid us.[A]
[Left]Even so, we don't know if they can truly be[NL]
controlled. Would Cesaria and Arcanae[A][NL]
truly ally against us, or would it[NL]
become a three pronged conflict?[A]
[FarRight]Ideally, it will be a three way fight, but[NL]
we will have the advantage of the city.[A]
[Right]You're proposing we capture Bacrun,[NL]
and then allow them to come to us?[A]
[Left]How will we guarantee that?[A]
[FarRight]Even if they don't, Bacrun cycles all[NL]
resources that they either need from each[A][NL]
other or from us. They could choose to[NL]
ignore us, but sooner or later, they will[A][NL]
lose the support for the war effort.[A]
[FarLeft]So either they come to us and we fight[NL]
them off, or the war ends because they[A][NL]
run out of resources to maintain it...[A]
[Left]Hang on. Have we considered the possibility[NL]
that perhaps Cesaria or Arcanae would[A][NL]
attempt to counterattack Haedric and[NL]
lay ruin to our home?[A]
[Right]Neither Cesaria nor Arcanae have ever seemed[NL]
to have any interest in anything in[A][NL]
Haedric. Plus, with Bacrun obliterated by the[NL]
fighting there, they won't have sufficient[A][NL]
supplies to attack Haedric.[A]
[FarRight]Either way, we resolve their[NL]
conflict, without taking a side.[A]
[FarLeft]Why not negotiate with Bacrun?[NL]
Or even with Cesaria and Arcanae?[A]
[FarRight]Bacrun's Council of Guildsmen are all greedy[NL]
bastards, only caring about the coin.[A][NL]
Same with the mercenary group that defends[NL]
the city. As for Cesaria and Arcanae,[A][NL]
this war has gone on too long. Their base[NL]
ideals are just too vastly different.[A][NL]
Even if they resolve the war with a treaty,[NL]
there will be a level of hostility[A][NL]
politically, economically, even physically[NL]
along the border. The hero Efil[A][NL]
temporarily resolved it ten years ago,[NL]
but as we can see, it was only[A][NL]
temporary. If he couldn't do[NL]
it, I highly doubt we can.[A]
[FarLeft]So this is really our only option...[A]
[FarRight]That is correct. What do you all say?[A]
[Right]I have no idea that's better.[A]
[Left]I agree. It's our only real idea.[A][ClearFace][LoadArya]
I'm just along to see how this all goes.[NL]
So long as I get my pay, I'm happy.[A]
[FarRight]What about you, [Tact]?[A]
[FarLeft]I say we do it. As Adlez and Vicar said,[NL]
we have no better idea. We might as well[A][NL]
capture Bacrun and see where it takes us.[NL]
Even if we have to make a break for it[A][NL]
when the two superpowers come knocking,[NL]
we'll at least be a lot richer.[A]
[FarRight]I'm glad we are in agreement! Now,[NL]
I don't want to use the artifact[A][NL]
for this assault quite yet...[A]
[Right]So then what's the plan?[A]
[FarRight]I will lead Haedric's warriors on a full[NL]
frontal assault. Meanwhile, you all will[A][NL]
slip in through one of the many entrances[NL]
into Bacrun and move straight for the[A][NL]
Council of Guildsmen. You're likely to[NL]
encounter some resistance, but your[A][NL]
mission is simply to capture their building.[NL]
If you do that, we have all the bargaining[A][NL]
chips, and therefore, control of the city.[A]
[Left]So you will serve as a distraction?[A]
[FarRight]I'm the Basileus. They'd assume me to[NL]
lead the main strike force. If I lead the[A][NL]
distraction, it will serve to[NL]
legitimize the strategy.[A]
[FarLeft]Makes sense to me.[A]
[FarRight]Good! Let us ready ourselves and depart.[NL]
These winds of change are set to blow![A][X]
