What the hell happened?[A]
[MidRight]Maximus got here first. Part[NL]
of his brigade is stationed here.[A][NL]
We're going to have to push through.[A]
[Left]Then we fight. We have to create[NL]
this opening for Lord Uzkalis.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadHelmer]
I agree.[A]
[MidRight]I don't want to involve the[NL]
townspeople though. We need to[A][NL]
seize the gate to the fort and move on.[A]
[Left]These people have aligned with Cesaria![A]
[MidRight]They want neutrality. I don't[NL]
want to rob that from them.[A]
[FarLeft]Let it rest, Val. Our fight is with[NL]
the Cesarian military, not a border town.[A][CloseSpeech][.....]
[Left]Very well.[A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadLuke]
They're approaching. We don't[NL]
have any more time to talk.[A][X]
