[MidLeft][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadLuke][Right][LoadArc]
So why is it you want all[NL]
of us to go to Shizon?[A]
[MidLeft]My role here has reflected badly[NL]
on my homeland. We aren't bandits.[A][NL]
We aren't terrorists. We're assassins with[NL]
honor. I never wanted to attack that[A][NL]
caravan. I feel as though you all[NL]
may not believe that fact.[A]
[FarRight]I believe you. I just don't see a reason[NL]
why I should want to go somewhere like[A][NL]
that. I've heard the rumors of the[NL]
Cult of Shizon. You've turned your[A][NL]
backs on the Higher Beings.[A]
[MidLeft]That's not true, though, Luke.[A]
[FarRight]What do you mean?[A]
[MidLeft]The leader of our order, Xexim,[NL]
has spoken with Higher Beings[A][NL]
before. He knows the truth.[A]
[FarRight]Spoken with them? And... the truth...?[NL]
What truth? Why should I believe you?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't have a lot of reason to trust me,[NL]
but you claim to be fully dedicated to[A][NL]
the Higher Beings. I'm telling that you'll[NL]
understand more about them and about[A][NL]
yourself if you go to Shizon.[A]
[FarRight]More about them...[....] And about me...[....][NL]
What if you're wrong?[A]
[MidLeft]It's not a one-way trip. If you decide once[NL]
you're there that it's not worth your[A][NL]
time, getting you back home will be even[NL]
easier than getting you to Shizon will be.[A]
[FarRight][TMM]...[.....][TMM] Very well. I'll go. Arc?[A]
[Right]I'm not convinced. I couldn't give two[NL]
shits about whether the Higher Beings are[A][NL]
real or not. All I care about is keeping[NL]
Danaan safe from this war. A war you[A][NL]
Shizonians claim to have no part of[NL]
but only prolong with your work![A]
[MidLeft][TMM]...[....][TMM] I will admit... You raise a very fair point.[NL]
It is true that we seem hypocritical by[A][NL]
claiming to be neutral, while we make our[NL]
services available to either side. But[A][NL]
I'm telling you, Arc, you'll understand[NL]
everything more if you come with us.[A][NL]
Danaan will be safe in your absence. This[NL]
is your opportunity to see the world.[A]
[Right]What makes you think I want to[NL]
see the world? I'm a woodsman.[A]
[MidLeft]Is it not typical of Haedrician men to[NL]
desire to journey Avenir, fighting the[A][NL]
strongest foes to prove their strength?[A]
[Right]So what if it is?[A]
[MidLeft]You're turning down the opportunity to go to[NL]
a land where the entire culture is based[A][NL]
being a strong assassin- a deadly one-on-one[NL]
fighter...[Smile][....] perhaps being even[A][NL]
better than a Haedrician warrior.[A]
[Right]When you put it like that, it is mighty[NL]
tempting... No Shizonian is stronger than[A][NL]
a Haedrician warlord. I'll easily prove that[NL]
one to you, but there's still Danaan.[A]
[FarRight]Arc, we killed Gerwick. There shouldn't be[NL]
anything more to worry about there.[A][NL]
Besides, we weren't the only members of the[NL]
militia. This is a tremendous opportunity.[A]
[Right]What about [Tact]?[A]
[MidLeft][Tact] already made a choice.[NL]
It's time to make yours, Arc.[A]
[Right]I suppose...[....][Events] I'll go.[A]
[MidLeft]You will? That's fantastic![A]
[FarRight]I'm glad you came around, Arc.[NL]
So, what next, Arya?[A]
[MidLeft][Tact] has already gone on ahead to try[NL]
to contact the person who can get us to[A][NL]
Shizon. We'd best be on our way. Port[NL]
Selsing in Arcanae is our destination.[A][X]
