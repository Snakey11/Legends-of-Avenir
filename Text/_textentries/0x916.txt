[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]Cesaria is ruled by the Emperor in tandem[NL]
with their General of the military.[A][NL]
Advising the General are the Captains of[NL]
the multiple brigades in their military.[A][NL]
They're the youngest country on the map,[.][NL]
but their quick expansion and great[A][NL]
military might in their younger days allowed[NL]
them to quickly conquer the lands they[A][NL]
now hold.[.....] They don't expand as much anymore.[....][NL]
They greatly disagree with the ideals of[A][NL]
Arcanae where knowledge is power,[.] and[NL]
scientific advancement is more crucial[A][NL]
than anything.[......] Cesaria's survival greatly[NL]
depends on the cooperation of the Emperor[A][NL]
and General,[.] but since the General is[NL]
appointed by the Emperor, that hasn't[A][NL]
been a problem in the past.[A][X]
