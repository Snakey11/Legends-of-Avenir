Arc...
[MidLeft]What do you want, [Tact]?
[MidRight]I'm so sorry...
[MidLeft]Well, sorry doesn't bring back my friends. My family. My people.
[MidRight]I know...
[MidLeft]Then leave me alone.[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveFarRight][MidLeft][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]
[FarLeft][LoadLux][Tact]?
[FarRight]What is it?
[FarLeft]I'm Vice-Captain Lux of the Tiger Brigade. Captain Maximus sent me to fetch you so you can talk further.[CloseSpeech][FarRight][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Right. Arc...
[Right]Just go.[X]

[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadMaximus]
Greetings, [Tact]. Do you want some tea?
[MidLeft]No thanks.
[MidRight]Very well. So, [Tact], I must admit... This war with Arcanae is an uncertain one. Both in our ability to find victory, and in our ability to allow other countries their neutrality. I worry that if it goes on much longer, Altia or even Haedric will be forced to enter the war.
[MidLeft]What does this really have to do with me?
[MidRight]Well, you did a great job recovering that artifact. It seems odd to place trust in any random freelancer, but... you seem trustworthy. You sought the bandits of your own accord. You're the exact kind of person I want on my side helping me.
[MidLeft]How will I make any difference?
[MidRight]I want to assemble a small strike force. A group that can slip past Arcanae's lines and make a beeline straight for the capital. Capture that, and Arcanae loses the source of their power and influence. It would deal a huge blow to them.
[MidLeft]Okay...
[MidRight]Most Cesarians aren't well-suited for that job. We're trained to fight as parts of a large group. This will be much more based on individual skill, something you definitely seem to have.
[MidLeft]What about Arc and Luke?
[MidRight]That's up to them. Lux?[CloseSpeech][MoveRight]
[FarRight][LoadLux]Yes, sir?
[Right]Bring the Haedricians here. They should be able to make their own choices.
[FarRight]Understood.[ClearFace]
[MidLeft]Luke had expressed a willingness, but Arc...
[FarRight][LoadLux]Here they are.[CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke]What's this about?
[Right]I'm assembling a strike force to go into Arcanae and take their capital. I asked [Tact] here to be a part of it. I figured I would extend the offer to you two.
[FarLeft]... I'm in. With Danaan gone... I don't know what else to do with myself. Continuing to journey seems like the best option.
[Right]Very well.
[Left]I'll be glad to have you along, Luke. Arc...?
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]... I want to see the destruction of Danaan for myself.
[FarLeft]Arc...
[FarRight]They could have made that up to keep us here! I want to confirm the damage for myself.
[Right]... Very well.
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLux]Sir?
[Right]Assemble the rest of the strike force.
[FarLeft]I'm on it.[ClearFace]
[Right]I'll escort you and the rest of the strike force to Danaan. Once you see what's there... You can make your choice. I'll brief the rest of the strike force on the entire mission from there.
[FarRight]... Thank you.
[Left]Guess this means the rest of us should pack our stuff up too.
[Right]We'll move out whenever you're ready. There will be a few Cesarian soldiers joining you as well. Vice-Captain Lux is getting them now.
[FarLeft][LoadLuke]Arc... What we find may not please you...
[FarRight]I know. But I have to see for myself.
[FarLeft]I understand... But please... Prepare yourself...
[FarRight]I'm more than prepared.
[FarLeft]...[X]

[Tact], these are Privates Jasper and Derek. They're recently graduated Cadets but both graduated near the top of the class. They'll be with us on this mission.[CloseSpeech][MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][LoadJasper]A pleasure to meet you, [Tact].[ClearFace]
[LoadDerek]What he said.
[Left]Captain Maximus assigned me to the mission as well, [Tact].
[MidRight]Glad to have the three of you along. Thanks for coming out here to check out Danaan as well...
[Left]The plan involves us moving into Arcanae from Haedric anyway. This is pretty much en route for us.
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadJasper]Wait, are we really able to make a strike against Arcanae from Haedrician territory?[ClearFace]
[LoadDerek]Yeah, aren't they neutral?
[Left]The Captain received approval from the Basileus for this operation. Hopefully Arc agrees to go with us...
[MidRight]Right... We'll need a guide through some of the thick forests at the border.
[Left]Exactly.
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadMaximus]Lux! You've brought [Tact] up to speed?
[Left]Yes, sir.
[FarLeft]Good. We're approaching Danaan now.[X]

No...
[FarRight][LoadLuke]Arc...
[Right]This can't... This can't be real... It's completely destroyed...
[Left][LoadLux]Jasper, Derek, secure our position.
[FarLeft][LoadDerek]We're on it!
[ClearFace][LoadPlayer]Arc... I'm so sorry...
[Right]... There's nothing to be done.
[Left][ClearFace][LoadMaximus]This is strange...
[FarRight]What is it?
[Left]It looks like others have been here... Recently, too...
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLux]Pillagers?
[Left]It must be...
[Right]What would they want here?
[Left]Collect any riches potentially left behind? I don't know.
[Right]How dare they deface my home...
[FarRight]Arc...
[Right][MoveRight]Maximus! Where can we find these pillagers you speak of?
[Left]The tracks lead off in that direction.
[Right]Good. Let's go, Luke.
[FarRight]... Right.
[ClearFace][LoadPlayer]I'm coming too.
[FarLeft]The Privates and I will too.
[Left]I'll stay here and secure the area. It may be a ruin, but it's not a bad place for us to finish discussing the plan when you all return.
[FarLeft]Understood.
[FarRight]I have some tracking experience. I'll lead the way.[X]

[MidRight]What are we waiting for? [MoveMidRight]Let's knock some heads!
[FarLeft]And I thought I was a maverick...
[Left]Be careful, Arc. We have to do this together. There looks to be a fair few of them...
[MidRight]I don't care! They taint my home, they die!
[Left]I guess we're doing this...![X]

Go to hell...
[FarLeft]It's done, Arc.
[Left]... I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't let them desecrate my home any longer.
[FarLeft]I understand.
[MidRight]Take a moment to rest, you two.
[Left]Thanks, [Tact].[ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight]Jasper, Derek, can[Left][LoadJasper][FarLeft][LoadDerek][MidRight] you two secure the perimeter? Make sure there are no stragglers or anything.
[Left]I'm on it!
[FarLeft]You can count on us.[ClearFace][Left][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadLux][Tact], let's talk with the Altians.[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveFarRight][MidLeft][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadLux]
[FarRight]Right. Finoc, Elanil! I'm [FarLeft][LoadFinoc][Left][LoadElanil][FarRight]glad to see you, but... why?
[FarLeft]Well, we have some good news.
[Left]Our Anguis has decided that Altia will enter the war. Arcanae is digging themselves deeper and deeper into dangerous research, and High Priest Izuk believes it could hold drastic effects upon Avenir if the war continues on.
[FarLeft]That's right. So, here we are. We were dispatched to assist you along with Captain Maximus. We're lucky we found you, to be honest.
[FarRight]No kidding. I'm glad to have you along.
[Right]Does Captain Maximus know you're here?
[FarLeft]All Cesarian Captains had a courier sent directly to them.
[Right]Perfect. Once Arc and Luke have rested, we'll be returning to Danaan to meet with Captain Maximus. For now, let's all get a bit of rest. That last battle was a bit tough. 
[FarRight]I agree. Get some rest, we'll return to Maximus when we're all ready.[X]

You're taking care of those bandits? I appreciate it. I wanted to do something about them myself, but I wasn't super comfortable without backup... Here, take this. It should come in handy.[X]

It's a shame what happened to that nearby town... Danaan, was it? These damn bandits only get bolder and bolder as this war goes on... I'm sorry, there was nothing I could do.[X]

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]
I've lived a long while, and seen this region of Haedric slowly sink further and further into chaos. It is horrible that they have gotten so bold as to raze an entire town to the ground, all under the nose of the local Warlord or the Basileus...[X]
