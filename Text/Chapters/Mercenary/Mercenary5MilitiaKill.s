[FarLeft][LoadKendrick][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadArc][Left][LoadArya]We've arrived.[A]
[FarLeft]I hope you all enjoyed your trip.[NL]
I'm gonna restock and then head back.[A]
[Right]Not gonna come with us?[A]
[FarLeft]Sorry, [Tact]. I've to have some way[NL]
of doing business, and Xexim[A][NL]
doesn't want me doing business here.[A]
[FarRight]Farewell, Kendrick![FarLeft][ClearFace][FarRight][NL]
Who is this Xexim fellow, anyway?[A]
[Left]He is the closest thing we have to a leader.[NL]
He upholds the Four Rulings and[A][NL]
also maintains the shrine.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Shrine...?[A]
[Left]The central one, anyway. There are many[NL]
shrines dotted around Shizon, all of[A][NL]
which dedicated to the higher beings.[NL]
Some are for angels, some are for[A][NL]
demons. It all really depends. The one[NL]
Xexim maintains is dedicated to[A][NL]
the Angel of Creation.[A]
[Right]So that's why Shizon has a[NL]
tie to the Higher Beings...[A]
[FarLeft][LoadXexim]Indeed. Arya, why have you[NL]
brought these outsiders here?[A][Right][MoveMidRight][Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadArya]
I felt you should meet them.[NL]
They are skilled, and-[A]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]You are an assassin, nothing more.[NL]
You know better than to see yourself[A][NL]
as a recruiter for our order.[A]
[Right]My last contract had me attacking them[NL]
with a group of bandits. It wasn't[A][NL]
assassination. It was banditry. That's not[NL]
our way. I wanted to prove that to them.[A]
[MidLeft]It was not your place.[A]
[Right]Xexim, please! Just hear[NL]
what they have to say.[A]
[MidLeft]Since they have come all this way...[NL]
It is not in my nature to turn[A][NL]
people away. What is it you all want?[A]
[MidRight]My name is [Tact]. I want to[NL]
understand the truth behind Shizon.[A]
[MidLeft]We do not reveal our customs[NL]
and traditions to outsiders.[A]
[MidRight]In that case, allow[NL]
me to become an assassin.[A]
[FarRight][Tact], you've gone mad![A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc][Tact], what the hell!?[A]
[MidLeft]Oh...[Smile] You wish to take[NL]
the test, do you...?[A]
[MidRight]I'm up for the challenge. How neat[NL]
would it be if I were one of them?[A][NL]
I feel this will be the best[NL]
way to hone my skills.[A][MidLeft][MoveFarLeft][Right][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadArya]
[Tact], the induction test is madness.[NL]
There's no way you can do it.[A]
[MidRight][MoveRight]Please, Arya. You did it, didn't you?[A]
[Left]Well, yes, but...[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke]I will accompany you, [Tact].[NL]
I also want to figure out the truth here.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Luke?[....] You're kidding.[A]
[FarRight]I'm curious to see what this 'test' is,[NL]
and perhaps I can gain some sort of[A][NL]
enlightenment from this experience.[NL]
It also seems that we're not leaving[A][NL]
any time soon.[.....] Are you with us, Arc?[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]Hmm... I'll go with ya. Can't deny that I'm[NL]
a 'lil curious about this place too.[A]
[Right][Smile]Luke... Arc...[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadXexim]You all may accompany [him], if you so[NL]
desire. Arya will be your guide.[A]
[Left]It would be my honor.[A]
[FarLeft]I will warn you that the test is designed[NL]
to be a challenge. It will not be[A][NL]
easy. Are you ready?[A]
[Right]Yes, I am ready.[A]
[FarLeft]Let's go.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaKillDealWithThemText
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadArya][MidRight][LoadXexim]I cannot help you from here. Your task is to[NL]
eliminate the foe, but also to discover[A][NL]
who they are. Good luck. I've got big[NL]
problems of my own to deal with.[A]
[FarLeft]Thank you, Xexim.[A][MidRight][ClearFace]
[Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadArya]Don't thank him yet.[NL]
We've got this task to get to.[A][FarLeft][MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke]Haven't you done this before, Arya?[A]
[Right][TMM]...[TMM][.......] Not[TMM]...[TMM][.....] exactly.[NL]
This isn't actually the trial to become[A][NL]
one of us. It is the trial of judgement upon[NL]
outsiders that come here. You are only[A][NL]
worthy to set foot in Shizon[NL]
by passing this test.[A]
[FarRight][LoadArc][Smile]Regardless, we're doing this blind?[NL]
That's fine by me! Any challenge[A][NL]
is welcome to a Haedrician warrior.[A]
[Left][Smile]Let's do this.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaKillWhatAreThese1Text
[MidRight][LoadPlayer]What are these things?[NL]
They're...[....] not human![A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left][LoadArya]I don't know. Discovering what they are is[NL]
part of our task, is it not?[A]
[FarLeft]They must have something to do with[NL]
Higher Beings if Shizon has such[A][NL]
a close tie to them.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]Fight now, think later![A]
[MidRight]Right![A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaKillKendrickHereText
[FarLeft][LoadKendrick]There you all are! Seems[NL]
I'm a little late to the party.[A]
[FarRight]Kendrick! What are you doing here!?[A]
[FarLeft]I heard about the little incident with the[NL]
outsiders coming to Shizon. I figured as[A][NL][FarRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadArya][FarLeft]
the one who took them there, I might[NL]
as well take some responsibility.[A][NL]
Wouldn't do me any good to[NL]
lose some customers, would it?[A]
[FarRight]It's good to have you,[NL]
Kendrick. Look sharp![A]
[FarLeft]You got it![A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaKillKendrickHereDeadText
[FarLeft][Smile][LoadKendrick]There you all are! Seems[NL]
I'm a little late to the party.[A]
[FarFarRight]Kendrick! What are you doing here!?[A]
[FarLeft]I heard about the little incident with the[NL]
outsiders coming to Shizon. I figured as[A][NL][FarRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadPlayer][FarLeft]
the one who took them there, I might[NL]
as well take some responsibility.[A][NL]
Wouldn't do me any good to[NL]
lose some customers, would it?[A]
[FarRight]But Kendrick... we can't ask you to fight.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]Perhaps, but I think I'll[Smile][NL]
have something useful for you later.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaKillWhatAreThese2Text
[Right][LoadLuke][Left][LoadKendrick]These beings seem to shatter when you[NL]
kill them. What are they?[A]
[Right]They each possess a small fraction of[NL]
Vene... But there's absolutely no Inge[A][NL]
within them at all. They have no humanity...[NL]
What power is this?[A]
[FarRight][LoadPlayer]We're just gonna have to keep[NL]
observing their fighting patterns.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArc]Aye. You keep studying, Luke.[NL]
We'll hold them off.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArya][Smile]I'd have to bet you're[NL]
on the right track.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaKillEndingText
[Left][LoadArya][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadKendrick][FarLeft][LoadLuke]They're... Constructs. Bodies created to[NL]
fight, but nothing more. They must've been[A][NL]
made by Higher Beings,[NL]
but what truly are they...?[A]
[FarRight]Allow me...[A]
[Right]Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight]You know me, I used to be a pirate.[NL]
I spent a lot of time in a[A][NL]
lot of different places.[A]
[Left]Kendrick, what are you doing?[A]
[FarRight]You know they won't solve it without[NL]
this added info. I know Xexim wants them[A][NL]
to pass. He really is a softie at heart.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Yeah, he sure seemed like a[NL]
softie when he was about to kill us.[A]
[FarRight]The point is, these are the same things[NL]
that guard the ancient ruins[A][NL]
in Draterus. They're remnants of[NL]
the Vathrylian empire.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]You don't mean... Vathrylian Guardians!?[NL]
I would've thought they'd be gone![A][CloseSpeech]
[Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadArya][Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]Please elaborate, Kendrick.[NL]
How are they here?[A]
[Events]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadXexim]There is no need. I have seen all that[NL]
I need to know. You seem worthy, but[A][NL]
any tests for what I need will need to[NL]
be put on hold. I require your immediate[A][NL]
assistance. Yesterday, I recieved word[NL]
that a branch of the Cesarian[A][NL]
military is en route to Shizon.[A]
[Left]I'll bet they're not[NL]
coming on good terms.[A]
[FarRight]Right. They have naval[NL]
escorts and everything.[A]
[Right]What!? I thought we had an agreement! We[NL]
make our services available to both[A][NL]
countries, and they don't target us...[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]I'd guess with all the hostilities on[NL]
the mainland, traditional diplomacy[A][NL]
has kind of gone out the window, no?[A]
[FarRight]Yes. Unfortunately, very rarely is[NL]
a large portion of the population present[A][NL]
due to job requests and such.[NL]
Especially in times like this.[A]
[Left]Leaders want assassins to kill their[NL]
enemies, be it across countries or not.[A]
[FarRight]I may have respect, but Shizon has no[NL]
leader. I can't call them back. They would[A][NL]
probably answer my call, but it goes[NL]
against my belief in my role here. Even[A][NL]
if I did, they wouldn't get here in time.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]How have you guys lasted so[NL]
long without a leader?[A]
[Right]We make a pact when we agree to become[NL]
Shizonians. When we break the terms of[A][NL]
that pact, the Four Rulings, we die.[NL]
Most minor issues are upheld by[A][NL]
the more respected members, like Xexim.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Bound by a pact, eh? You all certainly[NL]
always have surprises up your sleeves.[A]
[FarRight]We don't have time to discuss all this now.[NL]
I need your help. Defeat the Cesarians[A][NL]
that are coming to attack us.[NL]
I've seen proof of your conviction.[A]
[Left]I think the best option is to split up.[NL]
If they're coming at us from different[A][NL]
angles, it's best for us to[NL]
defend on different fronts.[A]
[FarRight]I will defend the shrine.[NL]
They cannot enter that place.[A]
[Left]Sounds good. Arc, come with me to the[NL]
market district. Arya and Luke,[A][NL]
can you defend the village?[A]
[Right]Of course. Our homes will not[NL]
be destroyed on my watch.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]I'll act as the reserve. I'm[NL]
betting they're using the standard[A][NL]
Cesarian Navy attack strategy.[A]
[Left]And that is...?[A]
[FarRight]Two main squadrons. One will have a high[NL]
ranking officer with them,[A][NL]
likely a Captain or a Lieutenant, while[NL]
the other will mostly be a[A][NL]
distraction. I'll head wherever[NL]
the Captain goes.[A]
[FarLeft]How are they able to be so organized and[NL]
blind to the lives of their troops?[A]
[Right]When you've got an empire with the size and[NL]
diversity of Cesaria, it's not too hard.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadXexim]We are short on time.[NL]
You must go! I feel this will[NL]
be of use to you. Use it well.[A][X]
