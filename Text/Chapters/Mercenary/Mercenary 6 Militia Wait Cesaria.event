Ah, you've returned... With guests?
[FarLeft]I'm Sergeant Finoc of Altia. You should have received a missive from our Anguis?
[MidRight]Ah that's right. Didn't expect you to join up with us so soon.
[FarLeft]We Altians move quickly. This is Corporal Elanil.
[Left]A pleasure to meet you, Captain.
[MidRight]We're glad to have you two along. I think this squad will work well for the operation I have in mind...[FarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadArc]
Captain, count me in.
[MidRight]Are you sure, Arc?
[Left]Yes. I've seen Danaan for myself. Those pillagers may not have been the one who destroyed it, but removing them makes me feel better. I'm under your command.
[FarLeft]I'll be glad to have you at my back, Arc.
[Left][Smile]You can count on me.
[MidRight]So you're all in? Good. Now, let's discuss the plan at hand...[X]

## Merc6MilitiaWaitCesariaWMText
#Lux: The goal is for a small strike force to make it to the Arcanian Capital, undetected, and take out the leaders of New Arcanae, namely Uzkalis and Xavus. It will have to be quick, or else they'll catch on. A small group would not be able to last very long against Arcanae's elite if they were to pull forces back from the border where they fight Jurgen.
#Maximus: Thankfully, Arcanae does not do a good job of guarding their northern border, particularly the further east you go. While there are watchmen and border guards, there's hardly anything that could be called a standing force.
#Finoc: Slipping past undetected will still be difficult... The forests at the border are thick enough that you won't easily be able to just get by.
#Maximus: That's why I intend to lead a strike along the western part of the border with the rest of the Tiger Brigade. That should lure most of the stronger parts of the border guards away from the border.
#Avatar: Okay, and what if it doesn't?
#Lux: We'll just have to fight our way through them. Leave no survivors. If they raise the alarm, we're done.
#Maximus: Lux is right. Once the mission starts, there's no way to go back. It could already be more than the Tiger Brigade can handle.
#Avatar: So just so we're clear... Our strike force will stake out one of the paths into Arcanae. Once a large portion of their force is drawn away by the Tiger Brigade, we'll strike swiftly so that no messengers can escape. Then, we push to the capital of Arcanae, trying to remain undetected so we can take out Uzkalis and Xavus.
#Maximus: That's quite right.
[X]

That's a big risk you all seem willing to take...
[Right]That's what I'm told by the other Captains...
[FarLeft]Still, I'm guessing Cesaria's casualties on the border aren't sustainable forever.
[Right]Quite so. We have the advantage in numbers, Arcanae has the advantage in firepower.
[FarRight]Now that you know the exact plan, are you still in?
[Left]I am.[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]
There's nothing for me in Danaan now. Might as well see what the rest of the world looks like.[Left][ClearFace][LoadLuke]
Arc summarized my feelings too. I'm with you.[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadFinoc]
Sounds like it could be fun. Elanil?[Left][ClearFace][LoadElanil]
I'd rather do this than be on the front lines.
[FarLeft]Agreed. We're in.
[Right]Perfect. Lux will be leading you on this mission. And, of course, Jasper and Derek are accompanying you as well.
[FarRight]That should be a sufficient strike force.[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Makes sense to me. When do we put this plan into action?
[Right]You all should start moving to the border as soon as possible. We can't risk my attack starting too soon. When you get to the border, wait for something to happen. I've discussed fallback plans with Lux in case you wait too long or something goes awry.
[FarLeft]Not for public consumption?
[Right]Not yet.
[FarRight]Don't worry, [Tact], it's nothing to be worried about.
[Right]I've given you the plans. I must return to the Tiger Brigade so we can prepare for our assault. Good luck, friends. I hope to see you in a few days' time in the Arcanian Capital, with Uzkalis and Xavus' heads on pikes![X]

I must confess, my wyvern doesn't love being below all the trees...
[MidRight]Used to the free sky, eh?
[Left]Yeah, he doesn't like being confined to the ground.
[FarLeft]Make sure he doesn't complain too loudly...
[MidRight]Hey, Derek![FarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][MidLeft][LoadDerek]
What's up, [Tact]?
[MidRight]Was just a bit curious as to what you can tell me about Cesaria. I can't say I fully understand their motivation in the war.
[MidLeft]Truth be told... Jasper's far better for that question. I just kind of enlisted for the pay. Farm work wasn't quite right for me.
[MidRight]I see...[CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadJasper]
What are you guys talking about?
[Left]Oh, [Tact] wanted to know a bit about why Cesaria is in this war.
[FarLeft]I mean, I'm no expert, but I can tell you what I know. Arcanae and Cesaria have been at each other's throats for awhile. I think a large part of it is just a disagreement between the two countries, but it's also gotten worse. The crisis ten years ago, which the hero Efil resolved, revealed that certain parts of Arcanae's research were slowly crippling the world. Uzkalis and Xavus advocated trying to continue research in a way to continue advancement without causing the same issues. The other Magi just wanted to either continue their old research, or stop altogether. So a civil war broke out in Arcanae.
[MidRight]So that's how Uzkalis and Xavus hold all the power in Arcanae right now...
[FarLeft]Pretty much. However, Cesaria wasn't willing to let them upset the balance in that way, so we've stepped in to try and stop Uzkalis and Xavus so as to reinstate the structure of Five Grand Magi.
[MidRight]An intervention, of sorts. Why does Cesaria care?
[Left]The balance of Avenir is a delicate one. Plus, General Rex doesn't entirely trust Xavus...
[MidRight]Interesting...
[FarFarLeft]Jasper! Derek! We're getting close. We're gonna try to set up camp in a nearby clearing, but no fires. We can't give away our position.
[FarLeft]Understood, Vice-Captain![ClearFace]
[Left]We're on it![ClearFace][MidLeft][LoadLux]
[Tact], there's a border crossing a short distance from here. It has a squadron of pretty strong looking Arcanian soldiers, not something we can easily deal with right now. We'll want to periodically send scouts out to try and keep an eye on their movements.
[MidRight]Got it. I'll let the others know.
[MidLeft]Thanks.[X]

[Tact], wake up!
[MidLeft]Huh?
[MidRight]It's our turn to go scout out the Arcanians. Let's go.
[MidLeft]Got it.[X]

[MidRight][LoadSoldier1][MidLeft][LoadSoldier3]
Imagine being stuck here, on the border with Haedric. There's nothing to do!
[MidRight]No kidding. So many others are seeing good action on the front lines with Cesaria, but here we are.
[MidLeft]Haedric's neutral anyway, it's not like they're going to just attack us. They don't care!
[MidRight]Right!? Yet Xavus is supposed to be the smart one...[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveFarRight][MidLeft][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadSoldier3][MidLeft][LoadEdward]
You two, shut up.
[Right]Sorry, sir!
[MidLeft]I just received word. There's a Cesarian Brigade striking to the west. They need assistance. I'm sending you two and a few others to help. The rest of us will stay here.
[Right]You said you wanted action...
[FarRight]Dammit all...
[MidLeft]Get moving![X]

Looks like they're going.
[MidLeft]Right. Let's wake the others. We have to go hard and fast.[X]

[MidRight][LoadElanil][MidLeft][LoadLux]
The attack has begun?
[MidRight]Yes. A portion of the Arcanian forces at the outpost have left to go and support the resistance against Maximus.
[MidLeft]We have to move quickly then.[MidRight][ClearFace][FarRight][LoadJasper][Right][LoadDerek]
I'll take point!
[FarRight]I'll wake the others.[ClearFace]
[MidLeft]Thanks, Privates. We need to move quickly.[X]

[MidLeft][LoadLux]
They'll know we're coming.[MidRight][LoadFinoc]
I can take Elanil to the capital and scout around fairly easily. If anything is looking awry, getting back to you will be no issue.
[MidLeft]Hm... I lack the Captain's mind for strategy...[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveFarRight][Right][LoadPlayer]
I think Finoc has the right idea. We need to start moving for the capital as soon as possible. While we do so, he can fly ahead with Elanil to scout out what it looks like we're dealing with.
[MidLeft]But the numbers...
[Right]It'll take the fleeing soldiers time to reach the capital, then they have to get to the deployed soldiers at the border, then they have to return. We have time to make this work. Finoc, you move quickly. You need to get Elanil to the capital, then immediately get word to Captain Maximus.
[FarRight]It'll be a stretch, but I can make it work. I'll want to leave some gear here. Make the load lighter, you know?
[Right]Whatever works. The rest of us will start moving to the capital.
[MidLeft][Tact]... Thanks.
[Right]No worries. I understand that you're flustered. But we don't have time to waste.
[MidLeft]You're right.[CloseSpeech][FarRight][ClearFace][Right][MoveFarRight][MidLeft][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadLux]Jasper! Derek! We're moving out!
[Left][LoadDerek][FarLeft][LoadJasper]I'm on it!
[Left]I just wanted one nice rest...[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]
Get used to it, Cesarian.
[Left]Yeah... I guess you're right.
[Right]Don't waste time! Move![X]

[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadLux]
That was relatively easy to clear up.
[MidLeft]Yeah, but we have to move quickly. They'll notice this soon.
[MidRight]Right...[CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadArc]
Luke and I are ready to head out at any moment.
[MidRight]We'll need some reconnaissance. We also need to get a message to Captain Maximus.[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadFinoc]
I can get Elanil to the capital to scout things out then fly a message to the Captain. I have the mobility advantage.
[Right]Right, many of you Altians are trained as couriers.
[FarRight]Can't say I've been a courier for awhile, but I'm happy to temporarily fill that role.
[Right]Right. Let's do that. Everybody else, get ready to move. We don't want to waste too much time. Jasper! Derek! We're moving out![FarRight][ClearFace][LoadJasper]
I'm on it![ClearFace][LoadDerek]
I just wanted one nice rest...
[FarLeft]Get used to it, Cesarian.
[FarRight]Yeah... I guess you're right.[Left][ClearFace][LoadLuke]
Come on, we have to get going![X]
