[MidLeft][LoadLuke][Tact], wake up![A][NL]
[MidRight]Huh?[A]
[MidLeft]Maximus[MidRight][LoadPlayer][MidLeft] wants to speak with us.[A]
[MidRight]Oh, sorry, I'm on my way.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaPlansText
[FarLeft][LoadLux][MidRight][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadMaximus]
Ah, you're here, [Tact]. Thank you.[A]
[MidRight]So what's the word?[A]
[Left]Vice-Captain Lux here was scouting out in[NL]
Draterus to keep track of Uzkalis'[A][NL]
movements. She had just started her report[NL]
when I decided to send for you.[A]
[MidRight]Understood.[A]
[FarLeft]Sir, thank you, sir. I was tracking the[NL]
movements of Arcanae through the desert.[A][NL]
They seemed to be heading for various[NL]
locations of ruins, but took a slight detour.[A][NL]
I don't think they had originally been[NL]
prepared to journey into Draterus itself, so[A][NL]
they took a detour to stop at an Oasis.[A]
[MidRight]Are those rare in the desert?[A]
[Left]Very. Because of that, we have a good[NL]
idea of where Uzkalis and his men[A][NL]
are right now. Continue, Lux.[A]
[FarLeft]Last I checked, they had divided their forces,[NL]
likely to widen their search for artifacts.[A][NL]
Many of them still reside at the Oasis. I[NL]
believe that if we attack that group and[A][NL]
capture the Oasis, we could scatter[NL]
a large portion of Uzkalis' men.[A]
[Left]That definitely seems like a good plan. I[NL]
have to return to Cesaria and mobilize the[A][NL]
rest of the Tiger Brigade, I understand that[NL]
Xavus' main force is moving towards the[A][NL]
border. Lux, [Tact], I leave you two to lead[NL]
the operation in Draterus. I'll leave a few[A][NL]
graduated cadets as well. Derek! Jasper![A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadDerek]
Private Derek reporting for duty.[A][ClearFace][LoadJasper]
Private Jasper, sir![A]
[Left]You're being sent into Draterus with the[NL]
Vice-Captain and [Tact], here.[A][NL]
You'll be answering to them.[A]
[FarRight]Understood.[A]
[Left]I've made arrangements for a small[NL]
supply convoy to accompany you.[A][NL]
I will return as soon as I[NL]
am able. I wish you all luck.[A]
[FarLeft]Godspeed, Captain.[A][CloseSpeech][Left][ClearFace]
[Right]See you around. So when[NL]
do we move out, Lux?[A]
[FarLeft]Likely in about an hour. Go[NL]
speak with your friends for now.[A]
[Right]Will do.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaArcPlayerText
[MidLeft][LoadArc][MidRight][LoadPlayer]
Hey, Arc.[A]
[MidLeft][Tact]... *sigh* I'm such a fool.[A]
[MidRight]Arc, you can't cling to what happened[NL]
to Danaan. It's not any of our faults[A][NL]
individually. Blame Gerwick[NL]
for being a fool.[A]
[MidLeft]It was my choice to leave.[NL]
I should have stayed. We[A][NL]
should have divided[NL]
and conquered.[A]
[MidRight]And then what? All three of us would be[NL]
dead and Danaan would still be destroyed.[A]
[MidLeft]I'd rather have died doing my[NL]
duty than live knowing I failed.[A]
[MidRight]I'd rather honor their memory[NL]
by doing what I know is right.[A][CloseSpeech][.......]
[MidLeft][Tact]...[.....][A]
[MidRight]Arc. It's your choice what[NL]
to do with your life.[A]
[MidLeft]I'm coming with you. Perhaps I'll[NL]
find a new purpose in our journey.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Thank you, Arc. I appreciate it.[NL]
It brings me great comfort having[A][NL]
someone I can thoroughly rely on.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]You can rely on me so long as I[NL]
believe this is a path to follow.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadLuke]
Arc! [Tact]! Lux is calling[NL]
us! We're heading out.[A]
[MidRight]We're on our way![A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitJasperDerekText
[FarRight][LoadJasper][Right][LoadDerek]
How far to the oasis? This heat[NL]
is killing me in this armor.[A]
[FarRight]Calm down, Derek. I'm used to riding a[NL]
horse everywhere, having to walk[A][NL]
[Left][LoadLux][FarRight]and lead it on is killing my feet.[A]
[Left]Quiet, you two![A]
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer]Calm down, Lux. The wind is blowing at[NL]
us, so our voices won't carry[A][NL]
forwards to our quarry.[A]
[Left]You really have no idea of[NL]
protocol, do you?[A]
[FarLeft]I'm a freelancer, not a soldier.[A]
[FarRight]Hey, [Tact], what is[NL]
Haedric like, anyway?[A]
[FarLeft]What do[Left][ClearFace][FarLeft] you mean?[A]
[FarRight]Well, we've heard the culture there is[NL]
vastly different from Cesaria.[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
I suppose you could say that. We're not quite[NL]
as organized as you Cesarians, with your[A][NL]
brigades and strict hierarchy. We call our[NL]
leader the Basileus. Basileus Leon was[A][NL]
selected by the last Basileus, but normally,[NL]
the Basileus will hold a tournament to[A][NL]
select the strongest warrior as their[NL]
successor. Haedric itself is mostly ruled[A][NL]
by the Warlords, who often squabble with[NL]
each other, but no other nation on[A][NL]
Avenir has quite the same strong sense[NL]
of nationalism that Haedricians share.[A][NL]
If there's a matter of national importance,[NL]
everyone will follow Basileus Leon into[A][NL]
battle, regardless of past quarrels.[A]
[Right]That seems... Unstable.[NL]
Isn't there fear of civil war?[A]
[MidLeft]Do you all fear the General[NL]
turning on the Emperor?[A]
[Right]I suppose not. Is it really that similar?[A]
[MidLeft]From my experiences, yes.[A]
[FarRight]There were concerns about Captain Maximus'[NL]
predecessor, but he was killed in[A][NL]
battle and Maximus succeeded him. Just[NL]
like if the Captain were to die now,[A][NL]
Vice Captain Lux would succeed him. We[NL]
all trust each other, so long as we[A][NL]
have such a strong leader like[NL]
General Rex leading us.[A]
[MidLeft]I suppose we're all more[NL]
similar than we seem.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadLux]
Quiet down! We're near the oasis where I[NL]
saw Uzkalis' men before. It looks[A][NL]
like Uzkalis himself isn't there...[NL]
But we might as well strike now.[A]
[Left]Understood. Arc, follow me.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]
I'm right behind you, [Tact].[A][ClearFace][LoadJasper][FarLeft]
Derek, Jasper, go with them. Time to[NL]
prove yourselves, rookies. Luke[A][NL]
and I will head up the back.[A]
[FarRight]Yes, sir![A]
[Right]I'm on it.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaGrantText
[FarRight][LoadGrant]
Dammit, it's a surprise attack! Come on[NL]
men, we have to fend them off! If[A][NL]
we lose this position, we lose our[NL]
home base for this desert excursion![A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaElanilFinocHereText
[FarLeft][LoadElanil][Left][LoadFinoc]
What's that there?[A]
[FarLeft]It looks like a skirmish between[NL]
some Arcanians and Cesarians...[A][NL]
But... is that [Tact]?[A]
[Left]Looks like it. Luke and[NL]
Arc are with them too.[A]
[FarLeft]Then what are we waiting for?[NL]
We're siding with Cesaria.[A]
[Left]I don't know. I never thought I would be the[NL]
one to cause a declaration of war between[A][NL]
Arcanae and Altia. But here we go![A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaGrantBattleText
[FarLeft][LoadGrant]
Grr... I'll handle this myself![A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaGrantDeathText
[FarLeft][LoadGrant]
Lord Uzkalis...[CloseEyes][....] Glory[NL]
to...[....] Arcanae...[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaEndingText
[FarLeft][LoadDerek][Left][LoadJasper][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadLux]
Well done! Derek, Jasper,[NL]
secure this position![A]
[FarLeft]Understood![A]
[Left]Will do![A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][Right]
Arc, would you [MidLeft][LoadArc][Right]lend them a hand?[A]
[MidLeft]It would be my pleasure.[A][ClearFace][....]
[Left][LoadElanil][FarLeft][LoadFinoc][Tact]! You're here![A]
[Right]Finoc! Elanil! Thanks for the help back[NL]
there! What brings you here?[A]
[Left]The Anguis told us that Altia is going to[NL]
side with Cesaria in this conflict. We[A][NL]
were dispatched to rejoin with you. Didn't[NL]
expect to find you out here in Draterus.[A]
[Right]We joined up with Cesaria too.[NL]
Finoc, Elanil, this is Lux, Vice[A][NL]
Captain of the Tiger Brigade.[A]
[FarRight]It's a pleasure to meet you both. Thank[NL]
you for joining this conflict on our side.[A]
[FarLeft]It was the decision of Anguis and High[NL]
Priest Izuk. We're just following orders.[A]
[FarRight]I still thank you for your assistance. I[NL]
will send a messenger bird to Captain Maximus[A][NL]
at the capital to inform him and the rest[NL]
of the leadership of this new development.[A][ClearFace][.....][LoadLuke][Smile]
Elanil! Finoc! You're here.[A]
[Left]Luke! It's good to see you. Didn't[NL]
realize it would be so soon.[A]
[FarLeft]Looks like we're all back together.[NL]
Care to fill us in, [Tact]?[A][FarRight][Smile]
[Right]Sure thing. Uzkalis and his branch of the[NL]
Arcanian military has fled into Draterus.[A][NL]
They were using this Oasis as a sort of base[NL]
camp, so we decided to strike here first[A][NL]
to make the rest of them easy pickings.[A]
[FarLeft]I see. Where is Uzkalis now?[A]
[Right]Likely exploring ruins[NL]
hoping to find artifacts.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadJasper]
[Tact]! It looks like some of the[NL]
enemies got away! Their tracks[A][NL]
are leading south, towards Bacrun.[A]
[Right]Bacrun? Damn, they're going to try[NL]
and sever the connection between[A][NL]
the nations. Where's Lux?[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLux]
I'm here. What's going on?[A]
[FarRight]A portion of Uzkalis' forces[NL]
are headed towards Bacrun.[A]
[FarLeft]Dammit. We'll have to move quickly.[NL]
Everyone! We head south for Bacrun![A]
[FarRight]Yes sir![A]
[Right]I hope we haven't made a mistake by[NL]
targeting the men at the oasis...[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaHouse1Text
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan1]
We don't see people out here too[NL]
often... I would've thought[A][NL]
your meaningless war would steer[NL]
clear of Draterus. We came out[A][NL]
here to escape your politics...[NL]
Just... Take this and leave us.[A][X]

## Merc5MilitiaWaitCesariaHouse2Text
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan4]
Starting a battle in Draterus... The[NL]
Wanderers may not take too kindly[A][NL]
to that... You'll want to end this[NL]
quickly and get out. For your sake,[A][NL]
for their sake, and for our sake.[NL]
I suppose it's fair I help you out.[NL]
Just a little bit though. Take this.[A][X]
