The Basileus is the greatest warrior in the[NL]

see fit,[.] simply to avoid infighting.[.....][NL]
The few laws are upheld by the warlords[A][NL]
and clans who serve the Basileus loyally.[.....][NL]
There are also many mercenary[A][NL]
guilds and bandit groups scattered[NL]
throughout the forested country.[A][NL]
They underwent major reform about 50 years[NL]

Arcanae,[.] and a new Basileus was chosen.[A][X]
