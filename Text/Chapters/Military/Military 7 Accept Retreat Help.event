Are we all here? Good. This is the day where we fight Xexim.
[FarRight]The leader of Shizon... Greatest Assassin in Avenir...
[Right]Don't underestimate him. I've left my crew back at the ship. They'll ensure that we have a way back home.
[Left]I'm impressed, Kendrick. You've really pulled through on this.
[Right]I always pull through!
[Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]What's our plan?
[FarLeft]We'll want to proceed cautiously. Xexim is more than just a skilled assassin.
[FarRight]What do you mean?
[FarLeft]Xexim is one of the enforcers of the old Guardian Spirit, Kilthel.
[Right]The same Kilthel who Efil defeated ten years ago?
[FarLeft]The very same. Kilthel had four allies, known as the Four Orden. At the time, we thought Xexim was our ally... He helped us defeat Kilthel, and so he lived on. But it's clear it was only temporary. He's a relic of an age long past.
[Left]He needs to die. I understand.
[FarRight]I think we all stand with you, General Rex.
[Right]Speak for yourself...
[Left][ClearFace][LoadYvette]Kendrick!
[Right]... Oh, all right.
[FarLeft]If you're all ready, I'll lead the way into the temple. Be on your guard.
[Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]We're with you, General.[X]

So, Rex, you've arrived.
[MidRight]Xexim! You knew we would be coming.
[MidLeft]Wasn't sure how personally you'd take it.
[MidRight]You owe me an explanation. You said Shizon would never take a side in the war.
[MidLeft]... I owe you nothing. This place will become your tomb, Rex.[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadKendrick]
I hear it isn't so bad to be buried in a temple... Something about higher beings blessing you.
[Right][ClearFace][LoadYvette]If we fall here, we're bringing you with us!
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadAdeline]You transgressed against Cesaria, Xexim. We won't let you win!
[Right][ClearFace][LoadRemus]I will stand by General Rex. You can't stop us!
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadJasper]We've made it this far... We won't lose now.
[Right][ClearFace][LoadDerek]Allow me to be your shield, General, so that you may strike at this man!
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]We're with you, General.
[MidLeft]Pathetic... I will have to show you your transgression! Shizonians, to arms![X]

There's... so many...
[Right]As if one wasn't enough... Nobody wants to see more of your face, Xexim.
[Left]You will have to defeat all of us to defeat me. The Higher Being resting within this temple has given me his favor.[ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadRex]Damn you, Xexim... Listen up! We have to defeat all of Xexim's clones! So long as one remains, he can transfer his primary soul to that one's body.
[FarLeft][LoadJasper][Left][LoadDerek]What sort of power...?
[FarLeft]We need to focus, Derek! Give us your orders, General!
[FarRight]We fight! We can't fall here![X]

You should have kept your word, Xexim.[ClearFace]

What about the Higher Being within this temple?
[MidRight][OpenEyes]Higher Beings are gone. Even if there is one here, it won't care.
[FarLeft]Are you sure...?
[MidRight]Positive. You all did well to show mercy to the village. If there is a Higher Being, it likely cares more for the citizens of Shizon. Let's go. We must return to Cesaria.[X]

You did well, [Tact].
[MidRight]Thank you, sir.
[MidLeft]We aren't done yet. The war with Arcanae continues. I will want your help for this.
[MidRight]Of course. It's my duty, isn't it?
[MidLeft]Some people aren't bound by such things. Xexim saw it as his duty to keep the world balanced. But his offense towards us showed that his duty meant nothing to him...
[MidRight]But he's defeated now. What will become of Shizon?
[MidLeft]They'll live out their lives. I'll ensure that some trade still reaches them so they can still thrive.
[MidRight]That's very honorable of you...
[MidLeft]When you fight against an opponent, you only worry about those fighting with you. It's my duty as a leader of Cesaria to make sure that the countries we defeat aren't completely obliterated.
[MidRight]That sounds like quite a burden...
[MidLeft]It can be. Anyway, we've earned our rest. Kendrick set up some cots for us down below. Don't stay out here too long.
[MidRight]I won't. Thanks, General.[X]

Finally, he's gone.
[MidLeft]What the- Who are you?
[MidRight]I'm a Higher Being, for one.
[MidLeft]You're the one from Shizon?
[MidRight]Pfft, no. Being stuck in one place is awfully dreadful.
[MidLeft]Then what is it you want?
[MidRight]Your head, mainly.
[MidLeft]What!?
[MidRight]Don't try sounding an alarm, they're all below. It's just the two of us.
[MidLeft]What is it you want with me specifically?
[MidRight]I already said, lost soul, are you daft?
[MidLeft]Lost soul...
[MidRight]Ah, maybe you remember?
[MidLeft]You're the one that... gave me this life? The Guardian Spirit!
[MidRight]Yeah, yeah, yeah, you figured it out, congratulations! Now die.
[MidLeft]Not so easily![X]

Xexim is dead. Now, [Tact].
[MidRight]Sir?
[FarLeft]Because of your error, Shizon lays in ruin. Our duty was not eradication of a culture. Of a country.
[MidRight]I'm sorry, sir...
[FarLeft]Sorry won't bring back the lives of these Shizonians. I am glad you came here to assist me with my task, and part of the fault is my own for not being clear enough. Regardless, murder of innocent bystanders and destruction of their property is not how Cesaria fights a war.
[Left]All due respect, Rex, but I was the one who encouraged it. The fault lies with me.
[FarLeft]This is surprisingly genuine from you, Kendrick. But you are not a Cesarian soldier. I can't expect you to follow our morals.
[Left]Well, it was worth a shot.
[MidRight]Kendrick...
[Left]What's the sentence for [Tact], then? Get on with it, Rex.
[FarLeft][Tact]...[X]

Damn, he was more than I expected. Guess you Cesarians really do have powerful leaders. A shame... He'll be revived when I roll back time, at least.
[FarRight][LoadKendrick]Stay back, [Tact]. We don't have a chance against him. Yvette, we need to get back to the ship...[ClearFace]
[MidLeft]None of you are going anywhere. [Tact], is it? I have business with you, lost soul.
[MidRight][LoadPlayer]Who are you!?
[MidLeft]Hahaha! I'm the Guardian Spirit of course. You know, the one that gave you this opportunity of a lifetime? Really great, watching you obliterate Shizon like that. But the powers that be don't want me influencing the events of Avenir too much, so unfortunately, as my puppet, you must die.
[MidRight]No![CloseSpeech][MoveFarRight][Right][LoadDerek]
Stand aside!
[MidLeft]I have no time for this![X]

[MidLeft][LoadRex][MidRight][LoadPlayer]
General... Why is it that we're here? What caused this?
[MidLeft]Arcanae enlisted Shizon. We've discussed this.
[MidRight]Yes, but what would have pushed Shizon to drop their avoidance of the war? And what would have dragged Xexim himself into this?
[MidLeft]... Xexim and I fought alongside each other ten years ago, when the Hero Efil defeated the Guardian Spirit Kilthel. Despite being his ally, I didn't trust him. He was one of the Kilthel's most trusted allies, one of the Four Orden. I warned Efil about him, and he never listened... At the end of the war, Xexim returned to Shizon. 
[MidRight]Did he ever do anything that seemed sketchy to you?
[MidLeft]Not directly to us, but I found it hard to believe he'd align with us after centuries of serving Kilthel. If he was willing to betray him after that long, I found it likely he'd betray us quickly. Look what's happened now.
[MidRight]But why would he attack Cesaria...?
[MidLeft]Shizonians are followers of the Higher Beings. To a large degree, Cesaria has left any sort of reverence of them behind in light of what Kilthel was doing ten years ago. That disagreement has always left us slightly at odds...
[MidRight]So it's a religious disagreement?
[MidLeft]In a way, yes. It's also personal. Xexim's spent too much time in this world, and I think it's time for him to be done. It was wrong for Efil to trust him ten years ago, and he started this by making a move against me.
[MidRight]... I'm under your command, sir.
[MidLeft]I appreciate it, [Tact]. Here, take this. It's one of my personal weapons, but it'll serve you well in the coming battle.[X]
