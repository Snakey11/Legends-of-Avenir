[Tact], look. There's a structure over there.
[FarLeft]So, she wasn't lying...
[Left]What?
[FarLeft]Nothing. Let's get closer. Confirm it's untouched.
[Left]Zaheva, can you hold things down back here while we go check it out?[MidRight][LoadZaheva]
Yeah. I'll tell the others to get ready in case we head into the temple.[X]

[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadDerek]
Yeah, it looks like the place hasn't been touched in centuries.
[MidLeft]It's in surprisingly good condition though...
[MidRight]Yeah. But look there. The gate is sealed. I can't imagine any researchers would have re-sealed it had they investigated this place before now.
[MidLeft]Yeah. Doesn't look particularly hard to breach that gate, either. A temple this size must have some sort of artifact in it...
[MidRight]It looks uninhabited.
[MidLeft]Hm... Get the others. We're going to be heading in to see what we can find.
[MidRight]I'm on it.
[MidLeft]By the way, Derek...
[MidRight]Yeah?
[MidLeft]Thanks for trusting me on this.
[MidRight]Hey, I don't want to end up as a corpse on the front lines anyway. Your plan makes sense to me.
[MidLeft]Right. Thanks.
[MidRight]Anyway, I'll go fetch the others. Maybe Zaheva will know something about this place.
[MidLeft]Yeah maybe.[X]

This temple... it's very old. It's definitely been untouched. There are faint traces of a seal over it...
[Right]Keeping us out?
[Left]No... Keeping whatever's in there inside...
[FarLeft]Why would they do that?
[Left]I don't know. Vathrylian Guardians that went rampant? There's no record of a temple like this that I've read, so I don't know much beyond what I can see.
[Right]So what's the plan, [Tact]?
[FarRight]Are we all geared up?
[FarLeft]Yeah.
[FarRight]We're gonna go inside.
[FarLeft]Are you sure, [Tact]...?
[FarRight]Yeah. Whatever's inside, we can deal with. Our only other option is wandering the desert until we find something more promising.
[Left][Tact] is right.
[FarLeft]... Alright. Let's go.[X]

[FarLeft][LoadRemus][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadDerek][Left][LoadAdeline]
Well, there's certainly a horde of Vathrylian Guardians...
[Right]It's nothing we can't handle. We'll have to get through them if we want to find any artifact that may be here.
[Left]Right. Remus, let's tear through these things.
[FarLeft]I'm on it.
[FarRight]I'll help take point.[X]

Looks like [Tact] finally found [his2] way here. Good. I can already feel the seal around the temple dissipating... Let's see how they fare against the Guardians. I'll wait here to see if they can reach me...[X]

[Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadZaheva][MidLeft][LoadXylia]
So, you made it.
[FarRight][Tact], who is this...?
[Right]Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. I wasn't perfectly convinced she really existed.[Right][ClearFace][LoadAdeline]
You knew about her?! You had us come here for a person instead of an artifact!?
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]Adeline, calm down! It's fine. Who are you?
[MidLeft]My name is Xylia. Some might call me an ancient remnant of the Vathrylian Empire.
[FarRight]Are you a Vathrylian?
[MidLeft]I suppose so. I do have extraordinary control over Vene.
[FarRight]You must, if you were able to communicate with [Tact] through the barrier sealing this place.
[Right]Here's the real question... why are you sealed here?
[MidLeft]What makes you assume the seal was put specifically on me?
[Right]Well, you seem to be the source of power here, which tells me it's not some artifact they wanted sealed here.
[MidLeft]I would assume it would be because of my place as one of the Four Orden.[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Four Orden...?
[MidLeft]We were the four servants to the previous Guardian Spirit, Kilthel. He blessed us with immortality in order to make us his enforcers. Two of my companions were slain by the so-called "hero" Efil ten years ago.
[Right]The original war between Arcanae and Cesaria...[ClearFace][LoadZaheva]
I thought that Efil resolved the war?
[MidLeft]Well, look at the state of the world now. Does the war look resolved?
[Right]No, I suppose not.
[MidLeft]Exactly. He sealed me away here knowing that I was beyond his ability to defeat, then killed my companions and Kilthel in an effort to save the world amidst the war. But then, he didn't bother to finish cleaning up. He didn't try to make lasting peace between the two nations.
[FarRight]Why exactly did he want to kill the Four Orden and Kilthel?
[MidLeft]The Vene and Inge was becoming unbalanced. Last time this happened, Vathryl was totally obliterated. Kilthel thought the easiest option was to convert all human lives into Pura to balance it out. Amassing an amount of Pura would allow it to turn into Vene and Inge at will, balancing the natural and magical energies of the world.
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]He wanted to mass murder everyone!?
[MidLeft]Essentially. But that's not my mission now. Arcanae has taken steps to make their research more efficient. Now, all I want is revenge. I want to kill Efil for what he did to me and my friends. Then, I'll help you with what you need.[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadAdeline]
You'll help us win the war?
[MidLeft]Win the war, or at least end it.
[FarRight]I suppose that's good enough...
[Right][Tact], can we talk about[NL]
this? Grab Derek too.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Yeah. Of course.[X]

[Tact], I need you to level with me. What all do you know? Do you realize who we're dealing with?
[MidRight]Well... Sort of. I know she's powerful, and I think she has the ability to come through on her promise about the war.
[Left]Who knows if she's trustworthy? It sounds like she's using us.
[MidRight]If she's not trustworthy, we'll have to deal with her ourselves. I think we've got it in us.
[FarLeft][Tact], if you trust her, I'm not gonna doubt you.
[Left]I wish I had your confidence. I'll trust you on this. I don't think Adeline's caught on yet, but as soon as she figures out how untrustworthy Xylia is...
[MidRight]It'll be fine. Derek will help keep her in the dark.
[FarLeft]Yeah. Jasper trusts me, and I think Adeline trusts him. If he works with us, I think Adeline will be fine.
[Left]You'd better bring him up to speed.
[MidRight]Yeah. You're right. This'll be fine. I don't trust Xylia, but she's just a tool for us.
[Left]You'd better hope so.
[FarLeft]Don't push your luck, [Tact].
[MidRight]Don't worry, I don't intend to. She thinks she's got control over us. Derek, if you keep Adeline at bay, Zaheva and I will keep an eye on Xylia.
[FarLeft]Sounds good to me. The further away I am from that woman, the better.
[Left]Don't think she won't be onto us, [Tact].
[MidRight]We'll just have to be careful. We're good at that.
[Left]I suppose so.[X]

[MidLeft][LoadYvette][MidRight][LoadAdeline]
I don't like this, Yvette.
[MidLeft]Why's that?
[MidRight][Tact]... They're not telling us everything. Who is this figure?
[MidLeft]I mean, if what she says is true...
[MidRight]That she's a Vathrylian that served the previous Guardian Spirit? Seems unlikely. But we do know that she was sealed here, and there has to be a reason for that.
[MidLeft]I mean, she wants to kill the Hero Efil...
[MidRight]Yeah, but you know as well as I do that Efil is meaningless. He may have saved the world from Kilthel, but it doesn't matter if this war continues on.
[MidLeft]I suppose you're right.
[MidRight]Remus, what do you think?[CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadRemus]
Well... I'm not one to go against my direct commanding officer.
[MidRight]What?
[FarLeft][Tact] is our commander here. If they choose to trust this Xylia character...
[MidRight]Dammit, Remus, have you learned anything?
[Left]He has a point, Adeline. It's not our place to question [Tact], though I'll admit, this whole venture has seemed sketchy from the beginning...
[MidRight]If Xylia is willing to help us win this war after we kill some hero who hid himself away, that's fine, but if she or [Tact] tries to make a move against Cesaria's interest...
[Left]Agreed.
[FarLeft]I...
[MidRight]What's it gonna be, Remus?
[FarLeft]... Agreed. If [Tact] does anything openly treasonous, they need to die.
[MidRight]Glad we got that squared away. I'll keep an eye on Xylia. Yvette, can you keep an eye on Zaheva?
[Left]Yeah.
[FarLeft]I guess I've got [Tact], then?
[MidRight]Yeah. You're more trusted than Yvette or I.
[Left]Speak for yourself.
[MidRight]... You're more trusted than I am.
[FarLeft]Right. I can do that.
[MidRight]Perfect. Now let's see exactly what Xylia has planned for killing a man who saved the world ten years ago...[X]
