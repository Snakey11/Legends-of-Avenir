[Tact]...
[MidLeft]What is it?
[MidRight]I'm sorry...
[MidLeft]Don't be. There was nothing you could have done, or that I could have done.
[MidRight]... We have to save those soldiers that were with the Vice-Captain.
[MidLeft]Are you okay? It's okay for you to rest a bit more before we move out...
[MidRight]I said my words. I know that Vice-Captain Blaine was... questionable in his methods, but he taught me everything I know... 
[MidLeft]I understand. Don't worry, we'll finish the mission he gave us. How is Remus doing?
[MidRight]He's fine. Blaine was never particularly nice to him, so...
[MidLeft]Got it. We'll be moving out to the fort within the hour. If you need more time, don't hesitate to ask...
[MidRight]I'll be fine. I won't let Blaine's sacrifice go to waste.[X]

Okay, everyone! We know that we've lost Vice-Captain Blaine. That being said, the war with Arcanae goes on, and our platoon is expected to capture the fort in this region of Arcanae.
[Left]Shouldn't we wait for Vice-Captain Lux?
[FarLeft]There isn't time, Jasper. Who even knows if she'll come?[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadZaheva]
Right. Not to mention, there's still part of Blaine's platoon captured in that fort.  As much as I want to go for Clint, those men's lives are on the line here.
[Left]... Alright. What's the plan?
[Right]We want to move quickly. They'll likely be taken aback at their losses in the battle yesterday.
[Left]Understandable. How are Adeline and Remus doing?
[Right]They'll be fine. Zaheva? What about you?
[FarRight]I'm fine. I trust I'll get my chance at Clint. If he's not at this fort, then I'm sure we'll run into him before taking the capital.
[Right]Right. I'm glad you're sticking with us.
[FarRight]Honestly... Seeing how easily he killed Blaine yesterday... I know I can't take him on my own.
[FarLeft]We'll help you. Don't worry.
[FarRight]I appreciate that.
[Right]Let's grab Remus and Adeline and get moving.
[Left]Right. I'm on it.[X]

There's the fort... It looks like they aren't ready for an attack right now.
[FarLeft]Derek and I will take point.[ClearFace][Left][ClearFace]
[Right]We have to move in quickly. They won't see us coming.
[FarRight]Right. We want to focus on defeating their leader and rescuing the soldiers they took captive.
[Right]Are we all ready?[MidLeft][LoadAdeline]
Let's go. I want to avenge Blaine.[X]

Corporal Helmer! There's a small assault from a group of Cesarians!
[MidLeft]What!? Duke Clint hasn't returned yet... Could this be the same group that defeated Val...?
[MidRight]They seem low in number, but skilled.
[MidLeft]We must hold them off! Don't let them free the prisoners!
[MidRight]We're on it![X]

Are those Cesarians...? Hey! Get us out of here! If we can make it out of this fort, we'll make sure you get rewarded![X]

[MidLeft][LoadCougar][MidRight][LoadLux]
Looks like they went ahead and continued their mission...
[MidLeft]They didn't want Blaine's death to be in vain.
[MidRight]Right. Thank you for bringing me here so swiftly, Cougar.
[MidLeft]I'm joining in the battle too.
[MidRight]Oh?
[MidLeft]You need all the manpower you can get. I'm under your command, Vice-Captain Lux!
[MidRight]Very well, then. Meet up with Corporal [Tact], so we can capture this fort, once and for all![X]

Are you Corporal [Tact]?
[MidRight]I am.
[MidLeft]Vice-Captain Lux of the Tiger Brigade. I just arrived here with Cougar.
[MidRight]Perfect, we need all the help we can get.
[MidLeft]We'll have to discuss strategy moving forward after the battle. For now, you know the situation, so we're under your command.
[MidRight]Understood. We just need to capture this fort and rescue the prisoners within.
[MidLeft]Got it. You can count on me.[X]

They're defeated. The fort is ours![MidLeft][LoadLux]
Corporal [Tact]?[CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadAdeline]
[Right]That's me. This here is Corporal Adeline. We led this assault.
[MidLeft]Very well done. First things first, I am sorry to hear about Vice-Captain Blaine. Captain Jurgen has been notified.
[FarRight]What's the plan moving forward, then?
[MidLeft]With the capture of this fort, Blaine's mission has been accomplished. Captain Maximus has secured the northern border with Haedric, so there's no escape for Xavus and Uzkalis.[CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadZaheva]
What about Clint?
[Left]Who is this?
[FarRight]She's Zaheva, an Arcanian who joined with [Tact] awhile back. She's trustworthy.
[Right]Adeline...
[Left]... Very well. Duke Clint is definitely still a threat. The fact that he was able to defeat Blaine so easily...
[Right]He'll be a difficult foe for us.
[Left]Captain Jurgen wants us to rejoin with the rest of the Lion Brigade at the capital to take on Xavus and Uzkalis directly. But we can't risk Clint striking us unawares during the siege...
[FarRight]What are your orders, Vice-Captain?
[Left]... We'll take just this small team. Any prisoners that survived or escaped can return to Captain Jurgen to prepare for the assault. I doubt Clint's manor will be overly defended in terms of numbers. You likely defeated a large portion of his forces here and in the plains.
[FarLeft]Really?
[Left]Yes. Captain Jurgen will just have to wait for us.
[Right]I'll let the others know.
[Left]Thanks, [Tact]. They can get some rest first, though. I don't want us to move on Clint's manor unprepared.[X]
