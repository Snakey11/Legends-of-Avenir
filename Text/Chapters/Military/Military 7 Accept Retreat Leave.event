So, Xylia, what is our plan of action for this?
[Right]Efil has sealed himself into the Temple of Kilthel in Draterus. Reaching the lower sanctum where he resides typically requires a Vathrylian artifact, but...
[Left]Let me guess, you can force your way in?
[Right]Essentially, considering the other Orden and I created the Temple in the first place.
[FarRight]Why the Temple of Kilthel of all places? Didn't you say that Efil was the sworn enemy of Kilthel?
[Right]It's... a long story. That is where the battle all those years ago ended.
[Left]Battle? I still don't quite understand just why you hate Efil so much.
[Right]... I suppose it would be much easier to show you then to tell you. Sit down for a moment and relax, so that I may show you just what transpired ten years ago...[X]

Efil is moving quickly. He's trying to find a way of stabilizing the Inge and Vene...
[Left]He's a fool. They are too far out of balance. If we don't do something, all of Avenir-
[FarRight]We know, Xylia. But you can't expect all of humanity to stand by as we harvest them for their Inge to rebalance the energies. They will fight to the bitter end.
[Left]I know... You'd think they'd be a bit less selfish...
[Right]Humans only care for their lives, not for the world they inhabit. They will die either way. This way, our world can endure, and other life can continue on.
[FarLeft]Regardless, we don't have much time. Efil is mobilizing the Sateenkaari to the north, and his close alliance with Maximus of Cesaria and Uzkalis of Arcanae means that we can expect parts of both those countries on our doorstep.
[FarRight]The Arcanians and Cesarians will never cease fighting, and because of that, the energies will only grow more imbalanced. I don't care what Efil thinks he'll accomplish... Unless he can convince them to permanently stop their warring, this world will end.
[FarLeft]You tried to convince him of his folly before, Servius. It's not worth it now.
[FarRight]I know.
[Right]My Orden, I will need you to aid me with this.
[FarRight]My blade is yours, Kilthel.
[Right]Servius and Arveldir, you two will stay here with me. I need your Artifacts to complete the spell.
[Left]And I?
[Right]Go to the Temple of the Sateenkaari with your Guardians. Demolish all of them that you can.
[Left]Of course. It would be my pleasure.[X]

So you were planning on... sacrificing humanity? To save the world?
[Right]As Kilthel said, you humans only care for your lives. Servius and I were more than prepared to give our lives to save Avenir.
[FarLeft]... Continue.[X]

They are routed. Many of Efil's followers lie defeated... But where is the man himself?
[MidLeft]Lady Xylia. Efil has escaped. They are sealing us within.
[MidRight]What? No! Dammit! I'll try to break the seal...
[MidLeft]It is a perfect one-way seal. There is no way out.
[MidRight]So we'll need someone to come here to break it? Dammit...
[MidLeft]Efil is already moving on Kilthel...
[MidRight]Kilthel... No![X]

[MidLeft][LoadKilthel][FarRight][LoadUzkalis][Right][LoadEfil]
Kilthel! Your tyranny ends here!
[MidLeft]If you are here... What has happened to Xylia!?
[Right]We've sealed her inside our Temple. She won't be able to help you now.
[MidLeft]My other Orden are still here.
[Right]We're aware. We think we can take them.
[MidLeft]And then what? All of Avenir will fall victim to the overflowing Vene!
[FarRight]Lies. Arcanae has agreed to halt their research in favor of protecting the world. Temporarily, of course, until we can find a better way to do it.
[MidLeft]And as soon as I, the threat to your livelihoods, is gone, then what? Cesaria and Arcanae will return to their war! The Vene and Inge will grow ever more unbalanced! At that point, if you aren't willing to give up your lives to balance the energies, then you'll die in the blight that will sweep Avenir.
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadMaximus]That's a risk we're willing to take. It at least gives us time to figure something out.
[MidLeft]So you mean to oppose me, a Higher Being?
[Right]If it gives us a chance at living, we'll do it.[X]

[Left][LoadZaheva][Right][LoadXylia][FarRight][LoadRemus][FarLeft][LoadPlayer]
Efil was willing to bank on such an unreliable strategy?
[FarRight]But... all of humanity... Was it really worth that?
[Right]Kilthel was going to give it time for the energies to stabilize before reintroducing humanity to Avenir. Sure, all of us who existed at the time were going to be gone-
[FarLeft]It seems like, as much as I don't like it, Kilthel was in the right. Efil's idea could have worked had he seen it through, but as is, I don't buy it. Kilthel was right, after all. Arcanae and Cesaria returned to their war once he was defeated.
[Right]So you understand now?
[Left]I do. [Tact]?
[FarLeft]I do too.
[FarRight]It all just seems to go a bit over my head.
[FarLeft]We'll help you defeat Efil, Xylia.
[Left]Agreed. It was foolish of him to risk so much and not see it through.
[Right]I'm glad you understand. 
[FarRight]I'm not sure about this...
[FarLeft]I won't force you, Remus, but consider your other options.
[FarRight]Yeah. I think you're right. I'll notify Adeline and Yvette.
[FarLeft]I'll tell Derek and Jasper to get ready as well. A few hours of rest and we'll be good to move out to the Temple of Kilthel.
[Right]Perfect. Thank you, all of you.[X]

[FarLeft][LoadYvette][MidRight][LoadRemus][Left][LoadAdeline]
Hm... What you've told us is concerning, Remus.
[MidRight]I know. But our best option is to go along with it. Best case scenario, she helps us after this is all through.
[FarLeft]I think Remus is right.
[Left]So it's just me finding this all suspicious?
[FarLeft]Oh, I find it suspicious, but I bet that if we were to try and fight Xylia now, we'd be dead too quickly. This way, if she's willing to help us, we've not screwed Cesaria over. If she isn't, at least the others will be on our side.
[Left]You make a good point, Yvette. We'll head out and help her with this task. But we all need to be on guard.
[MidRight]Right.[X]

[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadDerek][Right][LoadJasper]
So... This is our last task before heading back to Cesaria. And you're sure Xylia will help us?
[MidLeft]If she doesn't, we'll just have to take her down and head back to Cesaria empty-handed.
[FarRight]Right.
[Right]We've been fighting alongside together long enough that I trust you, [Tact], but I hope you know how big of a risk this is.
[MidLeft]I'm aware. But we have the strength of numbers over her. If she tries to turn on us, we make our move quickly and swiftly.
[Right]If you say so. Let's go ahead and get ready for this, then.[X]

This is the entrance to the Temple of Kilthel. Normally you require a Vathrylian Artifact to enter...
[Right]Let me guess, you have a way in?
[MidLeft]Vathrylian Artifacts are really just solid forms of Vene with Vathrylian incantations on them. The magic I use will have the same effect upon this gate.
[Right]...[.....] Sure enough. It opened.
[MidLeft][Tact]! Are you all ready to do this?
[FarRight]If we weren't ready now, we'd never be ready.
[Right]Right. Let's do this.[X]

This is it. The last fight.
[FarLeft][LoadAdeline][Left][LoadDerek]After this, we can crush Arcanae and finish off this war.

[FarRight][LoadRemus]We will.
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadYvette]It's our only hope.
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadZaheva]Never thought this is where I'd end up after joining with Cesaria, but hey. It's been a fun ride.
[Left][ClearFace][LoadJasper]Don't let me down now, [Tact].
[Right][Smile]Don't worry, I won't.
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadXylia]Remember everyone, we have to move quickly. Efil has some Vathrylian Guardians in service to him, but the Wanderers will also be swarming in here soon enough. They wouldn't want to miss a chance at my head.

[Right][LoadPlayer]Xylia, wait!
[FarRight]You dare stand in my way, [Tact]?
[Right]I want Efil to explain himself. Why he's secluded himself here. The full story and justification.
[FarRight]... Fine.
[MidLeft]When Kilthel was defeated, I wanted to believe that the rest of humanity would stabilize easily... I felt it was more likely everyone would be able to get along immediately after defeating a mutual foe like Kilthel. Either way, I would have disappeared at some point. If they weren't able to create peace without me now, then they wouldn't have been able to down the line. No human lives forever.
[Right]You wanted to restore the natural order of things, and felt that your presence and mediation upset that...
[MidLeft]That's a good way to put it.
[FarRight]But the least he could have done is ensured the stage was set! But instead, what happened? A new war broke out, and he couldn't be bothered to do anything about it!
[MidLeft]Sometimes, it's not that easy. This time, I had friends on both sides of the conflict. I couldn't afford to take a side.
[FarRight]Pathetic...
[Right]... When given the choice between the two... I think Efil is in the right. Xylia is on a mission for personal revenge, and I think letting the war run it's natural course will be the healthiest thing for the future of Avenir.
[MidLeft][Tact]...
