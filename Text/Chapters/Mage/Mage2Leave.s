So when will we see Mistlain?
[MidLeft]I'm not sure. He's a very busy person, I doubt he's too heavily interested in the events of our desert excursion.
[MidRight]Huh... What do we do with Lakshmi for the time being?
[MidLeft]I can turn her over to one of Mistlain's enforcers easily enough.
[MidRight]Teacher...
[MidLeft]What?
[MidRight]Lakshmi was your former student, right?
[MidLeft]Yes. She was a very accomplished mage and researcher, but I realized as time went on she wasn't in it for the knowledge... Lakshmi grew up on the outskirts of the capital. She sacrificed a lot to be able to come here and study with me. Naturally, she wanted to try and rise above her humble origins, so she gravitated toward Uzkalis and Xavus' revolution.
[MidRight]I see... You disagreed with that?
[MidLeft]The civil war and war with Cesaria mean nothing to me. I'm here to seek knowledge.
[MidRight]But we still serve Mistlain.
[MidLeft]No Arcanian gets anywhere without being subservient to one of the Grand Magi. Mistlain cares little for the affairs of the world, so I naturally gravitated towards him. Though he does take his research very seriously...
[MidRight]He won't be mad about our lack of success with this trip, will he?
[MidLeft]I'm not sure, but I wasn't willing to risk your life in that ruin.
[MidRight]Teacher... Thanks.
[MidLeft]Go ahead and get some rest, [Tact]. It's been a long day. I'll let you know when we're meeting with Mistlain.[X]

[Tact], wake up. Mistlain has summoned us.
[MidLeft]So soon?
[MidRight]Yeah. Let's go.[X]

[FarRight][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadXena][MidLeft][LoadMistlain]
Xena! And... [Tact], is it?
[FarRight]Yes, my lord.
[Right]It's good to see you, Lord Mistlain.
[MidLeft]Yes... If only I could share the sentiment.
[Right]My lord?
[MidLeft]You went to investigate the temple I sent you to in Draterus, yes?
[Right]Of course.
[MidLeft]And there you encountered your former student... Lakshmi, I believe?
[Right]I turned her over to one of your enforcers, yes.
[Events]
[MidLeft]There's a major problem here, however.
[Right]... What?
[MidLeft]We're neutral in this. Let Xavus and Uzkalis have their squabble with Muriel and Cesaria.[CloseSpeech]
[Right][MoveMidRight]You can't be serious...
[MidLeft]By detaining one of Uzkalis' retainers and not even returning with the artifact in question, I have no evidence to support that you were acting in self-defense.
[MidRight] ... So I take it Uzkalis is taking this as a declaration of your intention?
[Events]
[MidLeft]Yes. I have already rejected Cesaria. My ability to stand against Uzkalis is nonexistent... But, he did make a peace offering.
[MidRight]So it's come to this...
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]What? What's going on!?
[MidLeft]I have returned Lakshmi to Uzkalis. And... He's asked for the ones who detained her to be executed as recompense.
[FarRight][MoveFarRight]You can't do that! Master Xena's one of your most trusted researchers!
[MidLeft]Yes, she is, but unfortunately, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Soldiers! Detain Xena and the student!
[MidRight][Tact]! Behind me! We're getting out of here![X]

## Mage2LeaveSoldiersHereText

[MidLeft][LoadMistlain][Right][LoadXena][FarRight][LoadPlayer]
There's so many of them...
[MidLeft]I've built up a personal platoon of guards over time. I wasn't willing to let myself become totally passive, even if I have no interest in standing up to Uzkalis and Xavus. Good-bye, Xena.[X]

We're outnumbered...
[Left]We were when we fought Lakshmi too. We can handle this.
[FarFarRight]Stop right there! Come quietly or we will put you down now![CloseSpeech][Left][MoveFarLeft][Right][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
We won't go so easily!
[FarRight][LoadZaheva]Hm... That determination...[X]

[FarRight][LoadAjax][Right][LoadZaheva][MidLeft][LoadPlayer]
Who are you two?
[Right]No time to explain.
[FarRight]I know which way has fewer defenses. Follow me.
[MidLeft]But-[CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadXena]
Trust them, [Tact]! We don't have time to waste![X]

## Mage2LeaveTactAjaxText

[MidLeft][LoadAjax][MidRight][LoadPlayer]
So... Who are you?
[MidLeft]The name's Ajax.
[MidRight]Why are you helping us?
[MidLeft]Now isn't the time. Just know that I'm on your side.
[MidRight]Alright. I trust you.[X]

## Mage2LeaveTactZahevaText
[ConversationText]
[MidRight][LoadZaheva][MidLeft][LoadPlayer]
Who are you?
[MidRight]Zaheva.
[MidLeft]You don't seem like most Arcanians.
[MidRight]I've rejected the principles of our homeland. For now, that's all you need to know.
[MidLeft]... Alright.[X]

## Mage2LeaveAjaxXenaText
[ConversationText]
[MidLeft][LoadAjax][MidRight][LoadXena]
Ajax, was it?
[MidLeft]That's right. You're Xena, yeah?
[MidRight]That's right.
[MidLeft]I'll help you guys get out of here. We can talk more after.
[MidRight]Thanks for your help, Ajax.[X]

[MidLeft][LoadZaheva][MidRight][LoadXena]
You seem familiar to me...
[MidLeft]It's your imagination.
[MidRight]Hm. Very well. What's your name?
[MidLeft]Zaheva.
[MidRight]Thanks for the help, Zaheva.
[MidLeft]My pleasure. Just stick close to Ajax and I, and we'll get out of here.[X]

[FarLeft][LoadXena][Right][LoadZaheva][FarRight][LoadAjax][Left][LoadPlayer]
We made it out... Is everyone okay?
[FarLeft]I'm doing fine. Thank you for your assistance, you two.
[FarRight]It's our pleasure.
[Left]Why did you two help us, anyway?
[FarRight]It wasn't right for Mistlain to cave to Uzkalis' demands. I'm not willing to follow someone like that.
[Left]So you just... betrayed him?
[FarRight]He betrayed all of us by sentencing you all to death.
[Left]Huh...
[FarLeft]What about you, Zaheva?
[Right]I have no interest in the squabbles of Arcanae. Ajax roped me into this.
[FarLeft]What does interest you, then?
[Right]... Revenge. That's all you need to know.
[FarRight]You can trust her. At the very least, she won't stab you in the back.
[Right]So long as you don't stand in the way of my goal, we're good.
[FarRight]So what's your game plan? We'll go with you.
[FarLeft]Are you sure? Our best bet is probably to try and flee to Bacrun. Getting into Cesaria right now would be a nightmare...
[Left]Bacrun? 
[FarLeft]We should be able to get passports there. For now, we just need to put distance between ourselves and the city.
[Left]Right. Let's move.[X]
