[Left][LoadArc][Right][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadKendrick][FarLeft][LoadXexim]
I won't blame any of you[NL]
for turning back now.[A]
[Right]I'm a Shizonian. I stand by you.[A]
[FarRight]If Cesaria and Shizon break apart any[NL]
further, I lose my business. Seems[A][NL]
that killing Rex should solve[NL]
our problems.[A]
[Left]If Cesaria's looking to expand, Haedric[NL]
is up next, including Danaan. This[A][NL]
will be more help to my home than me[NL]
sitting around doing nothing.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke]
You allowed me to understand the truth of[NL]
Higher Beings. I would jump at[A][NL]
any opportunity to aid you.[A][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
[FarLeft]And you, [Tact]?
[FarRight][MoveRight]This is the path I have chosen.[NL]
I will stick to it.[A]
[FarLeft]Very well. Here's the plan. We will[NL]
wait for the cover of darkness. Once[A][NL]
we have it, we'll slip into the castle and[NL]
make our way towards General Rex's[A][NL]
chambers. I have no qualms with many of the[NL]
castle residents and would prefer to[A][NL]
only kill General Rex, but if things go[NL]
sour, we may have to fight some[A][NL]
of his men as well.[A]
[Right]The Dragon Brigade? Are[NL]
we up to the task?[A]
[FarLeft]You'd better be. If all goes well, we[NL]
can slip in and slip out. They'll[A][NL]
assume Arcanae hired someone to assassinate[NL]
Rex, give a promotion to one of the[A][NL]
captains, and all will return to normal.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillLukeArcText
[Right][LoadLuke]Just a few short days ago, I never[NL]
would've imagined me ever fighting...[A][CloseSpeech][MoveMidLeft]
...let alone sneaking into the[NL][MidRight][LoadArc][MidLeft]
Cesarian capital to kill their General...[A]
[MidRight]Life sure is funny, eh Luke?[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Arc, after this is done...[NL]
[Smile]I'd like to return to Danaan.[A][NL]
I think we can make a difference there.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]You think?[A]
[MidLeft]We've long[Smile] just let bandits prowl on[NL]
our lands[MidRight][Smile][MidLeft] and allowed ourselves to[A][NL]
sink into poverty... I think[NL]
that could change.[A]
[MidRight]I'd like to agree with you... Ever[NL]
since the first incident with Gerwick,[A][NL]
we've been going downhill.[NL]
[Smile]It's a deal, Luke.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight]
[FarRight][LoadKendrick][Smile]If you need a businessman to help[NL]
you get off the ground...[A]
[Right][Smile]You'd do that for us, Kendrick?[A][MidLeft][MoveLeft][Smile]
[FarRight]'course. A businessman never[NL]
misses an opportunity.[A]
[Left]You're a good man Kendrick.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArya]Hush up, you three.[NL]
We're getting close.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillNoOnesHereText
[FarRight][LoadXexim][Right][LoadArya][MidLeft][LoadPlayer]It looks like there's nobody around...[A]
[Right]That's odd... It's as if...[A]
[FarRight]... They know we're coming.[A][Right][MoveMidRight][MidLeft][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
[FarLeft][LoadSoldier1]Hey! Who are you?[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillShameText
[MidRight][LoadXexim]What a shame...[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillRexHereText
[MidRight][LoadXexim][FarFarLeft]There they are![A]
[MidLeft][LoadRex]Good work, men. [Smile]Well, well, well.[NL]
What have we here? Xexim of the Four[A][NL]
Orden, leader of Shizon. I must have[NL]
a bounty on my head indeed.[A]
[MidRight]You know what you did, General. You sent[NL]
Jurgen to Shizon and attempted to[A][NL]
desecrate the temple to the Higher Beings.[A]
[MidLeft]Ha! So this isn't an attempt enlisted[NL]
by Arcanae? It's a personal grudge?[A][NL]
This changes things.[....] This may be fun...[.....][NL]
I believe that goes against[A][NL]
your culture, Xexim.[A]
[MidRight]There are exceptions to those who[NL]
defy the Higher Beings.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadRex]Hmph. If you say so.[A][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadPlayer]
He's not alone, you know.[A]
[MidLeft]Oh, you brought friends. A lone[NL]
mercenary, a monk, a militia leader, one[A][NL]
of your followers, and a pirate-[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]
Businessman.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]...[......] Businessman. I've heard all[NL]
about you. Such valiant defenders. It[A][NL]
matters not. My men will make[NL]
short work of you.[A]
[Right]Damn you, Rex.[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][Smile][.....][ClearFace][.......][FarLeft][LoadArya][Left][LoadPlayer]
Xexim, we're gonna have to fight through.[A]
[FarLeft]He's right. If we retreat,[NL]
it'll mean the end of Shizon.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]We'll stand by you. If we[NL]
fall here, so be it.[A]
[FarLeft]If this is the will of the Higher[NL]
Beings, then they are right.[A]
[Right][Smile]I had no intention of[NL]
retreating. Let's go![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillThroneRoomText
[MidRight][LoadRex][MidLeft][LoadSoldier4]General Rex, we will stand[NL]
by you and fight. We of the Dragon[A][NL]
Brigade will face no opposition![A]
[MidRight]Thank you. Perhaps attacking[NL]
Shizon was wrong...[A]
[MidLeft]Sir?[A]
[MidRight]I believed that by destroying Shizon,[NL]
we could put an end to their habit of[A][NL]
being hired out both for us and against us.[NL]
A neutral country that isn't[A][NL]
truly neutral cannot exist.[A]
[MidLeft]You believed they were only[NL]
furthering the war?[A]
[MidRight]Yes. And their damned devotion to[NL]
those Higher Beings they love so much[A][NL]
clings to the past... Either we win here[NL]
today and the future is changed,[A][NL]
or I face the repercussions[NL]
for my actions.[A]
[MidLeft]We enlisted for a better future.[NL]
We will die to see that happen.[A][ClearFace][......]
[MidRight]Men of the Dragon Brigade! Today, we[NL]
fight to see a brighter future for[A][NL]
Cesaria, and all of Avenir! Assassins of[NL]
Shizon have invaded the castle! See[A][NL]
to it that the wart upon[NL]
Avenir is expunged![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillGuardsHereText
[FarRight][LoadRex]So you've made it this far, but[NL][Smile]
I have a few tricks up my sleeves.[A][NL]
Guards! To me![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillRexBattleText
[FarLeft][LoadRex]Here we stand. Just me...[.....][NL]
and you. You've cut through[A][NL]
my men, but I am of a better[NL]
cut than they![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillRexXeximBattleText
[FarRight][LoadXexim]Your time of judgement[NL]
has come, Rex.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillRexDeathText
[FarLeft][LoadRex]So this is it... The end of[NL]
my days... Glory to...[A][NL][CloseEyes]
Cesaria...[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillRexDeadText
[FarLeft][LoadXexim]Rex is gone. We have to get out[NL]
of here before the full brunt[A][NL]
of their force catches us![A]
[FarRight][LoadPlayer]Understood! Let's go![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillEndingText
[FarLeft][LoadArya][Right][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadXexim]We made it... [Tact],[NL]
[Smile]I thank you for your help.[A]
[Right][Smile]It has been my honor.[A]
[Left]I would be pleased for you to return to[NL]
Shizon with me. You would be a more[A][NL]
than worthy addition to our order.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArya]I would agree.[Smile] You are a skilled[NL]
warrior [Tact], and a good person.[A]
[Right]Arya... Thank you.[A]
[Left]What of the rest of you?[A]
[FarRight][LoadLuke]You provided me a very unique opportunity[NL]
to come to a greater understanding of[A][NL]
who the Higher Beings truly are. For that,[NL]
I thank you, but I don't believe[A][NL]
I can live in Shizon.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadArc]Danaan has been going downhill the past[NL]
few years. Luke and I think that we[A][NL]
can possibly make a difference in the town's[NL]
future if we use all that we have[A][NL]
learned on this trip.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]I too, will aid with Danaan. This[NL]
is an opportunity to expand my[A][NL]
business. Don't worry, I'll keep in touch[NL]
with Shizon. A businessman never[A][NL]
turns his back on patrons.[A]
[Left]I'm glad to see you all know what[NL]
you must do. May we all[A][NL]
meet again in the future.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaKillNarratorHereText
[MidLeft][LoadNarrator][MidRight][LoadPlayer]What the...? Who are you?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't recall? [Smile]Good. I must say,[NL]
[Tact]... You gave me more[A][NL]
entertainment than I've had since I got[NL]
this job. Becoming an assassin was[A][NL]
a rather bold move on your part.[A]
[MidRight]You're... The Guardian Spirit. It's[NL]
all coming back... If what Xexim says[A][NL]
is true, you haven't been the[NL]
Guardian Spirit for very long.[A]
[MidLeft]You're right, of course.[NL]
Was it worth it?[A]
[MidRight]How do you mean?[A]
[MidLeft]Did you enjoy your new[NL]
life, lost soul?[A]
[MidRight]I suppose you could say that. What[NL]
do you gain from this, though?[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Only souls of extreme power[NL]
are able to seperate from their[A][NL]
bodies as yours.[A]
[MidRight]So what?[A]
[MidLeft]I needed a spark. That war was going[NL]
to go on forever. But unfortunately,[A][NL]
it was only worth the entertainment. There[NL]
are rules for me, you see. I can't[A][NL]
manipulate the events of Avenir. But, I[NL]
can kill you. And I can control time.[A][NL]
If I kill you here and roll time back to[NL]
before I gave you this new life,[A][NL]
I have nothing to worry about.[A]
[MidRight]Wait...[A]
[MidLeft]Don't worry. You'll have another[NL]
opportunity to make your mark.[A][NL]
Until then... Goodbye, [Tact][A][X]
