[FarRight][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadArc][Left][LoadLuke][FarLeft][LoadArya][Smile]I've made arrangements. I have some[NL]
acquaintances from Bacrun who are coming[A][NL]
here to finish escorting the caravan so that[NL]
we can get to Shizon. I've also made[A][NL]
arrangements with an old friend[NL]
to bring us over to Shizon.[A]
[Right]Why should I leave my hometown[NL][FarLeft][Smile][Right]
relatively defenseless? I don't[A][NL]
like this. How about you, Luke?[A]
[Left]I... I would like to go. I'm curious of[NL]
their culture, and I think staying in[A][NL]
Danaan is a dead end for me. I want [NL]
to travel and uncover the[A][NL]
secrets of enlightenment.[A][NL]
[Right]I need time to mull this over.[NL]
Where would we be heading?[A]
[FarLeft]Port Selsing, off the southern coast[NL]
of Arcanae. It's not ideal for heading[A][NL]
to Shizon, but any closer and it[NL]
requires Cesarian Royal Approval.[A]
[Right]I'd prefer not to travel through Arcanae.[A]
[FarLeft]We don't really have a choice.[A]
[Left]They won't know where we come from.[NL]
I can pose as an Arcanian Duke.[A]
[Right]Aye, I suppose that is a possibility.[A]
[FarRight]When will your friends be here, Arya?[A]
[FarLeft]I'm not sure.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadEscort]
Oi! There you are Arya![A]
[FarLeft]Here they are now.[A]
[FarRight][MoveRight]So what's the job?[A]
[FarLeft][MoveLeft]We just need you to escort the caravan[NL]
to the capital of Haedric[A][NL]
so we can head to Shizon.[A]
[Right][Smile]I can do that. I'll assume[NL]
pay will come upon arrival?[A]
[FarRight]If not, head to Danaan. Tell them Arc[NL]
sent you. Here's a quick letter of proof.[A]
[Right]I appreciate it. Where[NL]
are you all headed?[A]
[FarLeft]We're going-[A]
[Left]To Shizon. That's all[NL]
you need to know.[A]
[Right]Very fair. Very fair.[....][NL]
Good luck, my friends![A][X]

## Merc4MilitiaKillOfficialsNoticeText
[FarRight][LoadArc][Left][LoadPlayer][FarLeft][LoadLuke][Right][LoadArya]All right. He should be[NL]
here before nightfall.[A]
[Left]I assume he's meeting us in the inn?[A]
[Right]Oh God no! We want as little contact[NL]
with this town as possible.[A][NL]
We just need to stay looking[NL]
as inconspicuous as possible.[A]
[Left]Yeah.[.] We blend right in...[A]
[FarRight]Guys! I think some official-looking[NL]
people just noticed us.[A]
[FarLeft]Okay. Let me do the talking.[NL]
Remember, you're all subservient to me.[A]
[Left]Great.[A][X]

## Merc4MilitiaKillOfficialsText
[FarLeft][LoadVal][Right][LoadLuke][FarRight][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadOfficial]Excuse me? May I[NL]
see your buisness papers?[A]
[Right]My papers?[....] [LoadLuke]How[NL]
dare you! I'm a duke.[A]
[Left]My appologies. May I see[NL]
your lineage papers then?[A]
[Right]Lineage papers?[....] They were...[.....] stolen.[A]
[Left]Stolen?[A]
[Right]Yes! Stolen. Would you believe it?[NL]
I was on a mission to convert those[A][NL]
ruthless, northern barbarians[NL]
when my caravan was ambushed.[A]
[FarLeft]How terrible![A]
[Right]My entire guard was killed, and I[NL]
barely escaped. My caravan was looted[A][NL]
of everything. I had enough on me to hire[NL]
these mercenaries to escort me[A][NL]
back home. I'm just releasing[NL]
them now. You're all dismissed.[A]
[FarRight][TMM]...[......] [TMM]Very well.[A][ClearFace]
[Left]And you've traveled all the way down to[NL]
the southern coast from Haedric?[A][NL]
[Smile]You must have past by the capital.[A]
[Right]My realm is just further down the coast.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveMidRight]
I'm staying here tonight,[NL]
and I'll be home by tomorrow.[A]
[FarLeft]We're going that way too.[NL][Left][Smile][FarLeft]
[Smile]Please let us accompany you.[A]
[Left]Val, you will learn to be[NL]
less trusting of strangers.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]Sorry, sir. You're right.[A]
[Left]You're the duke here, eh? You're[NL]
subservient to Uzkalis here, right?[A]
[MidRight]What? This is Muriel's domain.[NL]
I question your own validity.[A]
[Left][Smile]Very fair. Merely a test, my friend.[NL]
On your way, then, and my[A][NL]
appologies for your misfortunes.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Thank you for understanding.[....] Farewell.[A]
[Left]Farewell.[....] Come, Val.[A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][.......]I think the coast is clear.[A][CloseSpeech][......][MoveMidLeft]
[FarRight][LoadArya][Right][LoadPlayer]That was close.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke][Smile]I'm really glad I got that[NL]
book on global politics.[A]
[Right]Yeah. Really. Arya,[NL]
when will he be here?[A]
[FarRight]I really don't know exactly, but he'd[NL]
never lie to me. We just need[A][NL]
to lay low until he arrives.[A][X]

## Merc4MilitiaKillKendrickHereText
[FarRight][LoadKendrick][Smile]My oh my,[.] if it isn't Arya![A]
[FarLeft][LoadArya]Kendrick![A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight][Smile]There you are.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left][LoadArc]Who's this ruffian?[A]
[FarRight]The name's Kendrick. I'm a businessman, and[NL]
also a skilled skipper. I have a special[A][NL]
deal that lets me work with Shizon without[NL]
going through Cesarian politics.[A]
[FarLeft]That sounds...[.....] awfully handy.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]Do you not trust me, monk?[A]
[FarLeft]No, I do.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadPlayer]Calm down, Luke. What's[NL]
the deal, Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight]No deal. It's part of my business deal[NL]
with Xexim, Lord of Shizon, to escort[A][NL]
any Shizonians to and from the island.[NL]
You're all friends of Arya here,[A][Smile][NL]
so I'm sure it'll work out.[A]
[Left]Isn't Shizon strict about visitors?[A]
[Right]I'll take any blame for[NL]
that, don't worry.[A]
[FarRight]Anyway we've got everyone so[NL]
we may as well get going.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]What's the hurry?[A]
[FarRight][Smile]This isn't a place you want to stick around[NL]
for long in, monk.[.] Port Selsing is[A][NL]
the wart of Arcanae.[.] I'm surprised[NL]
they still let it exist.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]I'm game. Arc?[A]
[Left]I suppose there was nothing left for[NL]
me in Danaan. I'll go with you all.[A]
[FarRight]Perfect. Let's go.[A]
[Left]Wait. Let's stock up on some[NL]
weapons while we're here.[A][X]

## Merc4MilitiaKillPiratesHere
[MidRight][LoadKendrick][Left][LoadPlayer]So who are you really, Kendrick?[A]
[MidRight]Just a businessman. I handle a lot[NL]
of trade. My men are tough too,[A][NL]
so sometimes we take mercenary jobs.[....][NL]
I never got your name.[A]
[Left][Tact]. I'm-[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke]Uhhh...[....] I think I[NL]
see something out there.[A]
[MidRight]Nonsense.[A]
[Left][ClearFace][LoadArc]There's another ship over there.[A]
[MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadArya]Kendrick, what's going on?[A]
[Right][LoadKendrick]That ship...[....] Damn.[.] Thought I'd[NL]
finally gotten rid of them...[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]What are you on about?[A]
[Pause]
[Left]That flag...[....] I've seen it before...[.][NL]
The Dread Reapers' pirate crew?[A]
[Left][ClearFace][LoadLuke]They...[....] They kill in the[NL]
name of the demon Altorosk...[A]
[Right]It's a load of bull. I would know.[A]
[FarLeft]What?[A]
[Right]I used to be their captain...[NL]
'til I abandoned them in Altia.[A][NL]
They didn't appreciate that.[A]
[FarRight]You were a pirate!?[A]
[Right]And now I'm an honest businessman![NL]
Do me a favor and help me[A][NL]
get rid of these buffoons. I don't[NL]
think we can outrun them[A]
[FarLeft]I'd be glad to.[A][X]

## Merc4MilitiaKillRobertKendrickBattleText
[FarLeft][LoadRobert]You! Kendrick![A][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadKendrick]Come on. You can't really[NL]
believe all this, can you?[A][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadRobert]I always knew you were[NL]
never loyal to our cause.[A][NL]
For Altorosk![A][X]

## Merc4MilitiaKillEndingText
[FarLeft][LoadKendrick][Left][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadLuke][Right][LoadArc]What do we do with the ship?[A]
[FarLeft]Take the loot and start tearing[NL]
it apart. I'll be damned if I[A][NL]
ever have to see this ship again.[A]
[FarRight]But...[....] They were your[NL]
friends, were they not?[A]
[FarLeft]There are no friends in the pirate[NL]
business, monk. Only allies.[A][NL]
And sometimes, allegiances change.[A]
[Left]Kendrick...[....][A]
[FarLeft]Don't worry about it, Arya.[NL]
I'm glad to be rid of 'em.[A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]So how far to Shizon?[A]
[FarLeft]We should be getting close.[.] Don't fret.[A]
[FarRight]No friends...[....] Only allies...[....][NL]
This really is a cruel world.[A][CloseSpeech][Right][ClearFace][FarRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadArc]
You're overthinking it, Luke.[NL]
Just do what you believe in.[A]
[Right][MoveLeft][Right][ClearFace][LoadArya][Left][ClearFace][LoadLuke]But what do I believe in? Everything[NL]
I've thought has been proven wrong[A][NL]
on this journey. I just[NL]
don't understand any of this.[A]
[Right]The world is a cruel one, Luke.[NL]
People like you are few and far between,[A][NL]
who cling to the old writings of the[NL]
Higher Beings. Believe me,[A][NL]
all will be revealed in Shizon.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]Shizon... Land of the Assassins...[NL]
What do the Higher Beings[A][NL]
have to do with it, Arya?[A]
[Right]You'll understand.[NL]
Do not worry, [Tact].[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]There it is, on the horizon.[NL]
We'll be there soon.[A][X]

## Merc4MilitiaKillRobertDeathText
[FarLeft][LoadRobert]I've failed. Offer[NL]
me your judgement, Altorosk.[A][X]
