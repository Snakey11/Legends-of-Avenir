[Left][LoadPlayer]There's Danaan.[.....] It looks like I made it[NL]
here before the bandits.[A][NL]
I'll bet the head of[NL]
the militia is in here.[A][X]

## Merc2MilitiaInnText
[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadInkeeper]Welcome, traveller![.....][NL]
What brings you here?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I'm a freelancer,[.] looking for work.[....][NL]
I come with a message,[.] however.[A][NL]
Is there a militia in this town,[.][NL]
or even a Haedric Warlord?[A][NL]
[MidRight]Basileus Leon seems to think Danaan is a[NL]
lost cause due to our proximity[A][NL]
to Arcanae.[....] Arc is the closest thing we[NL]
have to a leader over there.[A][NL]
I'd speak with him.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Thank you for the help.[A][ClearFace][MidRight][ClearFace][.......][.......]
[MidLeft][LoadArc][.......][.......][MidRight][LoadPlayer]Arc,[.] is it?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Yeah. I'm the head of the[NL]
militia here.[....] Who are you?[A]
[MidRight]My name is [Tact]. I'm a[NL]
freelancer who just finished a job,[A][NL]
but I was attacked by highwaymen.[....][NL]
I bring concerning news.[A]
[MidLeft]There are all sorts of bandit groups[NL]
and highwaymen around here. We've[A][NL]
wanted to track them down, but we just[NL]
don't have the men to spare to do so.[A][NL]
We all have lives outside of fighting.[NL]
None of us are true Haedric soldiers.[A][NL]
[MidRight]I heard them mention the Gerwick[NL]
Bandits.[....] Have you heard of them?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Aye.[....] Gerwick was a lumberjack here awhile[NL]
ago, but was exiled after he was[A][NL]
found guilty of destroying a[NL]
tree near the Ingefont.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Ingefont?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Are you not familiar with Inge and Vene?[NL]
Inge is energy that gives life to[A][NL]
vegetation and strength to us warrior types.[NL]
It flows from Ingefonts, so we get[A][NL]
worried when people do damage to the[NL]
landscape near them. Vene is the energy[A][NL]
that mages use, but most of us here in[NL]
Danaan don't pay much attention to it.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Interesting.[....] I never realized that[NL]
warriors and mages use different[A][NL]
energy. Back to the matter at hand...[.......][NL]
I heard that the Gerwick bandits[A][NL]
were planning a raid on Danaan.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Really? Gerwick must be getting cocky.[NL]
Most of his men aren't real fighters,[A][NL]
and not that we are, but the Basileus has[NL]
been coming down hard on any bandits[A][NL]
that start infighting in Haedric.[A][NL]
[MidRight]What do you have in the way of men?[NL]
Could I be of assistance?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]We're a small militia, but-[A][NL][MidRight][MoveRight]
[Pause]
[FarRight][LoadMilitiaMan]Arc! Gerwick and his bandits are here,[NL]
and they're about to raid the village![A][NL]
The militia is all scattered![A][NL]
[MidLeft]Damn! I'm heading out now.[A][NL][FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right]I'll come too.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]This is our battle, so stay out of it![NL]
We don't have the money to pay you.[A][NL]
[Right]I don't need the money, but at this[NL]
point my choice is either kill or be[A][NL]
killed. I'd rather do the killing.[A][NL]
[MidLeft] ...[.......] Very well then.[.....] Come on![A][X]

## Merc2MilitiaOutsideText
[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadArc]All we have to do is hold off.[....] Gerwick[NL]
doesn't like to stay in one place for[A][NL]
very long.[......] He knows he can't stand up to a[NL]
force much more formidable than us.[A][NL]
If you kill him now, it will do the town[NL]
good, but don't risk your life for it.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Got it. Will it just be us two?[A][NL]
[MidRight]I don't really know. A lot of are woodsmen.[NL]
I bet the rest are far out. The only[A][NL]
one who I know is in town is Luke, a monk.[NL]
He's probably tending to the church.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Let's see if we can meet up with him.[NL]
The more men we have,[.] the better.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Got it.[....] If we stick together,[NL]
we should make it out of this alive![A][X]

## Merc2MilitiaGetLukeArcText
[MidLeft][LoadArc]Luke![A][NL]
[FarRight][LoadLuke]What's going on?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Gerwick is back.[A][NL]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]Ah...[......] The curse.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]This isn't the time for your[NL]
superstitions. This is a battle.[A][NL]
Grab your tome and help out![A][NL]
[MidRight]I wish that violence wasn't the answer,[NL]
but I know that Gerwick cannot be[A][NL]
swayed. Let us go, Arc.[A][X]

## Merc2MilitiaGetLukePlayerText
[MidRight][LoadLuke][MidLeft][LoadPlayer]Is your name Luke?[A][NL]
[MidRight]Yes it is. I am pleased to make your[NL]
acquaintance.[.....] And you are...[A][NL]
[MidLeft][Tact]. We have an issue right now.[NL]
Gerwick is back and we need your help.[A][NL]
[MidRight]What has possessed them to come here?[NL]
Does their greed corrupt them?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I don't know.[....] Will you fight?[A][NL]
[MidRight]I prefer not to, but in the face of danger[NL]
such as this, I have no choice.[A][NL]
I will join you and do my duty as[NL]
a member of the Danaan militia.[A][X]

## Merc2MilitiaGerwickDeadText
[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadArc][FarRight][LoadLuke]May you rest in peace,[.] Gerwick...[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I thought you all hated Gerwick.[A][NL]
[Right]He was a scoundrel and a dishonest man,[NL]
but he was still from Danaan.[A][NL]
We always honor our own...[.......][NL]
Where will you be going now?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I thought I might go to seek out more work.[NL]
Do you know of any jobs around here?[A][NL]
[Right]We're actually sending a caravan to the[NL]
capital to request a Warlord again.[A][NL]
Given the dangers we face now between[NL]
Arcanae and any of Gerwick's friends,[A][NL]
I thought Basileus Leon might listen[NL]
this time.[.....] I was planning on[A][NL]
accompanying it,[.] but we can always use[NL]
the extra manpower. With Gerwick gone,[A][NL]
I suppose the town is safe for now.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Sounds like a deal to me.[A][NL]
[FarRight]I want to come too. I feel as though[NL]
there's a truth I need to find.[A][NL]
Why did Gerwick do the things he did?[NL]
What is the source of his evil?[A][NL]
[Right]You're askin' yourself[NL]
impossible questions there, Luke.[A][NL]
[FarRight]I don't care. More and more I've felt[NL]
that the path I've chosen for[A][NL]
myself isn't entirely true...[....][A][NL]
[MidLeft]Great. I wouldn't mind journeying[NL]
with a group for awhile. I get[A][NL]
lonely working alone sometimes.[A][NL]
[FarRight]Thank you...[......] Shall we be off then?[A][NL]
[Right]Let's wait until the morning. There's[NL]
another merchant planning to arrive[A][NL]
this evening on his way to the capital,[NL]
and I figured we could travel with[A][NL]
him and his entourage, maybe[NL]
boost our numbers a bit more.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]It's a plan. Let's all meet[NL]
in the morning then, shall we?[A][NL]
[FarRight]Yes.[A][NL]
[Right]Deal.[A][X]
