[MidRight][LoadEmperor][MidLeft][LoadMaximus]
This way. The Temple of Kilthel is near.[A]
[MidRight]Why have you done this? I should have[NL]
stayed and died. This is the coward's way.[A]
[MidLeft]I'm sorry, sir. No soldier in this army[NL]
would let that happen. There's the[A][NL]
entrance. The inner sanctum will be closed,[NL]
but we can take refuge in the[A][NL]
upper levels. Leyos![A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadLeyos]
Aye?[A]
[MidLeft]Take the Emperor inside. You're the personal[NL]
bodyguard, you need to be in charge of[A][NL]
his protection. Why am I the[NL]
one sending him here?[A]
[FarRight]Understood. I always find it[NL]
amusing how comfortable you are[A][NL]
ordering your former superior around.[A]
[MidLeft]You retired from the position of General.[NL]
It's fairly simple. I'm sure [Tact]'s men are[A][NL]
on to us, and Uzkalis is also likely moving[NL]
to intercept. Get the Emperor inside.[A]
[Right]I will not stand idly by![A]
[FarRight]Sorry, my lord, but if you want to die,[NL]
they'll have to get through us first.[A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadEmperor][Left][LoadMaximus][FarRight][LoadUzkalis]
Oh, what have we here? A wandering[NL]
captain and the Emperor of Cesaria?[A][NL]
[Smile]It must be my lucky day.[A][Smile]
[Left]Uzkalis, you bastard.[A]
[FarRight][Tact] and his group will be here[NL]
soon. I'm not confident in my ability to[A][NL]
take on your whole brigade at once, Captain,[Smile][NL]
but I'm sure they will turn the tide.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeUzkalisGoneText
[FarLeft][LoadEmperor][Left][LoadMaximus]
Dammit! Tiger Brigade! Begin setting up a[NL]
defensive position inside the Temple![A][NL]
We need to protect the Emperor[NL]
at all costs![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeDesertText
[FarLeft][LoadFinoc][Right][LoadArc][FarRight][LoadHelmer][Left][LoadPlayer]
We're catching up to them. A whole[NL]
military brigade can't move too[A][NL]
quickly in this desert.[A]
[Right]I'm surprised we've had no[NL]
interference from the Wanderers.[A]
[Left]We're in a decently sized group.[NL]
They likely aren't fans of those odds.[A]
[FarRight]It's more likely they were scared off by the[NL]
Tiger Brigade. I can't say for sure though.[A]
[Left]Finoc, fly out and check on their status.[NL]
I don't want to lose too much ground.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]Seems scouting is what I'm best for. Don't[NL]
get into trouble while I'm gone again![A]
[Left][Smile]I don't intend to.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeUzkalisJoinsText
[MidLeft][LoadUzkalis][FarRight][LoadVal][Right][LoadPlayer]
Uzkalis! What a surprise. What's the word?[A]
[MidLeft]Not great. I need to speak with you and Val.[NL]
Maximus has holed his brigade, with the[A][NL]
Emperor, up in the Temple of Kilthel.[A]
[FarRight]Kilthel... The former Guardian Spirit?[A]
[MidLeft]Correct. He was dispelled ten years ago by the[NL]
hero known as Efil, who still resides in the[A][NL]
inner sanctum of the temple. But those[NL]
gates are sealed, so our foe[A][NL]
has trapped themselves.[A]
[Right]What's the catch?[A]
[MidLeft]Leyos, the former General of the Cesarian[NL]
Military, is with them. He's acting as the[A][NL]
Emperor's bodyguard. He's definitely a[NL]
foe to be reckoned with.[A]
[FarRight]Not to mention Maximus. He was known for his[NL]
hard work and training when he first rose[A][NL]
to Lieutenant, or so Helmer told me.[A]
[MidLeft]Correct. Xavus has defeated Jurgen and the[NL]
brigades at the border, and is moving to[A][NL]
the capital now. He wants us to return with[NL]
the Emperor's corpse before he gets there[A][NL]
so that none can contest his victory.[A]
[FarRight]So our only choice is to[NL]
charge into the Temple.[A]
[Right]Doesn't sound like our advantage. They[NL]
have numbers, a defensive position,[A][NL]
and two extremely strong warriors.[A]
[MidLeft]Indeed. The outer sanctum is rich with[NL]
treacherous terrain and traps. The[A][NL]
Vathrylians who created it always had a[NL]
way with making their temples into[A][NL]
elaborate death traps.[A]
[FarRight]That doesn't sound great for us...[NL]
What's your plan, Uzkalis?[A]
[MidLeft]We have no choice. We have to go in. I[NL]
plan on joining you in battle, of[A][NL]
course. I am the most [Smile]powerful[NL]
Thunder Mage in Avenir, anyway.[A]
[Right]You're sure?[A]
[MidLeft]You managed to defeat Rex, Zalius,[NL]
and the Dragon Brigade without me.[A][NL]
I have faith in you and your friends.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadFinoc]
[Tact]! It looks like the whole[NL]
brigade has entered the Temple[A][NL]
of Kilthel. Wait, Uzkalis?[A]
[Left]I just brought them up to speed[NL]
from my own expedition.[A]
[FarLeft]Ah, I see. So we have a plan?[A]
[Right]Almost...[A]
[FarLeft]So about as much of a plan as we normally[NL]
have. Well, you haven't led us astray[A][NL]
yet, [Smile][Tact]. I'll follow you.[A]
[Right][Smile]Thank you Finoc.[A]
[FarRight]I'm with you as well. When we first set[NL]
out, I wasn't sure what to make of you.[A][NL]
But you have honor and respect. You also[NL][Smile]
allowed Helmer and I to understand each[A][NL]
other better. My magic is yours to command.[A]
[Right]Val...[A]
[Left]It's time. Round up the others.[NL]
We can't delay any longer.[A]
[Right]Understood.[A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadArc][Left][LoadUzkalis][FarRight][LoadLuke][Right][LoadPlayer]
This is it. Today, we decide[NL]
the fate of this war.[A]
[Left]Indeed. I have faith.[A]
[FarLeft]I've come this far. This is for Danaan,[NL]
for Gerwick, and for all the misguided souls.[A]
[FarRight]I'm ready. I will finish this,[NL]
and find my purpose. The truth.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadElanil]
Arcanians, Haedricians, and Altians... A[NL]
funny combination. [Smile]Nobody else I'd rather[A][NL]
fight alongside exists, though.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadFinoc]
I trust you, [Tact]. We can do this. If[NL]
not, it's been one hell of a ride.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][Smile][LoadHelmer]
This is the time to make amends for what[NL]
was done to the Puma Brigade...[A][NL]
General Leyos... I'm coming.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadVal]
Mom... Dad... This is finally it.[NL]
I will avenge you both. Today.[A]
[Right]Let's go, everyone.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeCesariaInCaveText
[FarRight][LoadEmperor][Right][LoadLeyos][MidLeft][LoadMaximus]
They're coming. This is it.[A]
[Right]So we face the end of our days. I never[NL]
thought it would be here, of all places...[A]
[MidLeft]Ten years ago was the last time I stood[NL]
in these halls, as an attacker... Now[A][NL]
I defend the life of my Emperor.[A]
[FarRight]Maximus... Leyos... I can't thank you enough[NL]
for all you have done for Cesaria. You do not[NL]
need to sacrifice yourselves on my account.[A]
[MidLeft]Sorry, my lord. It's our duty.[A]
[Right]I dedicated my life to serving your[NL]
father, and now you. I'd rather[A][NL]
die than be robbed of that duty.[A]
[MidLeft]I ask you now to hide. Allow Leyos[NL]
and I to fend off Uzkalis and his[A][NL]
followers. Perhaps you will[NL]
have a chance to live.[A]
[FarRight]I will not run, however. If this is the[NL]
end of Cesaria, I go with it.[A][NL]
May I address the soldiers?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course.[A][ClearFace][FarRight][MoveRight]
Men of the Tiger Brigade![FarLeft][LoadSoldier2][Left][LoadSoldier5][Right][.....][NL]
Today, we face a great crossroads in our[A][NL]
empire. We either face the dusk, or the[NL]
dawn. But what will it be? That fate lies[A][NL]
on your shoulders. If we die here, it is in[NL]
honor! They will remember us! For better or[A][NL]
for worse, here we stand! I look out at your[NL]
faces, and I see good men. Honorable men.[A][NL]
There is nobody else I would rather die beside![NL]
For we are all Cesarians, regardless of[A][NL]
title! And we will not be silenced![A]
[Left]Aye! All hail his lord,[NL]
the Emperor of Cesaria![A]
[FarLeft]It is an honor to fight defending you![A][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][FarRight]
You did well, my lord. Now we must go.[NL]
Maximus will command the front lines.[A][NL]
We must stay back, and take an opportunity[NL]
to escape if it exists, though there[A][NL]
is only one exit.[A]
[Right]It's fine, Leyos. I wish to watch.[A]
[FarRight]Stay in the back, at least. I do not[NL]
wish for you to die as long as I stand.[A]
[Right]Very well.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeEndingBeginningText
[MidRight][LoadPlayer]Here they are. The Tiger Brigade. This is[NL]
it! Today, we end this! Let's go![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeMaximusBattleText
[FarLeft][LoadMaximus]So this is it... For Cesaria![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeMaximusDeathText
[FarLeft][LoadMaximus]Dammit... Leyos, I leave it to[NL]
you. You must... [CloseEyes]Live...[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadLeyos]Maximus! No![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeLeyosBattleText
[FarLeft][LoadLeyos]So you've made it this far.[NL]
Zalius, Rex, Maximus. Now me.[A][NL]
I have nothing to lose![A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeLeyosDeathText
[FarLeft][LoadLeyos]My lord... R-run...[CloseEyes][A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeLeyosDeadText
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadUzkalis][MidRight][LoadEmperor]
Leyos... Do with me what you will.[A]
[Left]I think I'll do just that. No reason[NL]
to keep you alive after all.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeEmperorDeadText
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadUzkalis][MidRight][CloseEyes][LoadEmperor]
And so...[....] Dusk falls...[.....][A][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]That's it. He's dead.[A]
[Left]We just have to take his body[NL]
back to Cesaria with us.[A][FarRight][LoadElanil][Right][LoadFinoc]
I'll have to report to the Anguis with[NL]
Elanil, so this is where we leave you.[A][CloseSpeech]
[FarLeft][MoveLeft]Finoc, it's been an honor.[NL]
You too, Elanil.[A]
[FarRight]Visit Altia sometime, [Tact].[NL]
It's freezing cold there, but we're[A][NL]
pretty hospitable. Take care.[A]
[Right]What she said. See you around.[A][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace][Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
I don't suppose you can just[NL]
warp us there, Uzkalis.[A]
[FarLeft]No, I can't. That only works on me alone.[A]
[Right]I should've expected as much. Let's go.[NL]
Might as well start moving.[A]
[FarLeft]Let's take a rest first. I know we're in[NL]
a rush, but a bit of rest can go a long[A][NL]
way, especially after a battle like that.[A]
[Right]I understand. I'll go ahead and take the[NL]
watch. The rest of you get some rest.[A][X]

## Merc7MilitiaWaitArcanaeNarratorHereText
[MidRight][LoadPlayer]
Did I make the right choice? What will[NL]
become of the citizens of Cesaria?[A]
[Pause]
[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]
A war... Rather different, but also typical[NL]
at the same time. It's only natural for[A][NL]
you to have sympathy for those lives you've[NL]
changed, and also those you've ended.[A]
[MidRight]What the!? Who are you!?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't recall? Probably better that way.[NL]
I am the Guardian Spirit. I'm the one[A][NL]
who gave you this life, lost soul.[A]
[MidRight]Lost soul...[....] It's coming back...[NL]
You caused this?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course! It gets awfully boring just[NL]
watching people fight back and forth.[A][NL]
Unfortunately, I lose my power if I allow this[NL]
to get out of hand, so it's really only[A][NL]
worth the entertainment.[A]
[MidRight]Wait, what are you suggesting?[A]
[MidLeft]I'm suggesting this is where your story[NL]
ends, [Tact]. I kill you, and roll back[A][NL]
time to before you're existence.[NL]
All is well.[A]
[MidRight]You're awful.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Oh no, I'm so wounded by a lost soul[NL]
telling me how awful I am. Come at me![A][X]
