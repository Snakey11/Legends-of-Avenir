I just received word that Cesaria and Arcanae[NL]
have mobilized. Unfortunately, they have[A][NL]
enacted a temporary truce until Bacrun is[NL]
under the Council of Guildsmen's control.[A]
[FarLeft]So we're on our own...[A]
[FarRight]We still have the artifact. It will help[NL]
turn the tide. But we need to have a plan.[A][NL]
The main Haedrician force took heavy losses[NL]
while distracting the mercenaries.[A]
[FarLeft]Most of my men are still around.[NL]
but they aren't much help[A][NL]
aganst an organized military.[A]
[FarRight]Correct. Under most circumstances, I'd[NL]
say we must defend on the outer edge[A][NL]
of Bacrun, but we would spread our[NL]
forces too thinly. We need to[A][NL]
fight them on the streets,[NL]
in a more individual context.[A]
[Left]That makes sense to me. Haedricians[NL]
aren't used to fighting in an[A][NL]
organized manner, anyway. It[NL]
certainly gives us an edge[A][NL]
over Cesaria and Arcanae. By[NL]
the way, have we tested the[A][NL]
limitations of the artifact yet?[A]
[FarLeft]We have not tested it, per se...[A]
[FarRight]Most artifacts of this type do have their[NL]
limitations. I would guess we only have a[A][NL]
few battalions of Vathrylians at our[NL]
disposal until the artifact loses its[A][NL]
energy and needs to recharge.[A]
[Right]So we have to rely on our own[NL]
skills and judgment. Against the[A][NL]
two biggest armies in Avenir.[A]
[FarRight]I trust you al. I believe we have a[NL]
chance. Now let's head out.[A][NL]
We have a hard fight ahead of us.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadAdlez]
Hey, [Tact].[A]
[MidLeft]You had something you[NL]
wanted to tell me?[A]
[MidRight]To be honest, [Tact]... I went into[NL]
this with full knowledge of the futility[A][NL]
of it. There's no way we can stand up[NL]
to both armies at once.[A]
[MidLeft]I agree... Do you think Leon sees it?[A]
[MidRight]I would guess as much. I think all of us do.[NL]
There's still a chance to make a difference.[A]
[MidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[MidRight][ToggleRed]Whether we fall or not does not matter,[ToggleRed] but[NL]
if you can manage to talk to both enemy[A][NL]
commanders before you fall... Our legacy[NL]
might live on, even though we don't.[A]
[MidLeft]I understand. Adlez,[Smile] it's been an[NL]
honor and a pleasure knowing you.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Likewise. Godspeed, my friend.[A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditXavusText
[FarRight][LoadXavus]
These fools... They think they can[NL]
stand up to the might of Arcanae?[A][NL]
Men, burn them to the ground! We[NL]
must recapture this city for the[A][NL]
council! We've temporarily made[NL]
a truce with Cesaria, only[A][NL]
attack the Haedrician dogs![A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditRexText
[FarLeft][LoadRex]
Soldiers of the Cesarian Army! Today, a[NL]
greater threat than Arcanae stands in[A][NL]
front of us. Move into the city and kill[NL]
the occupiers! Bacrun must be restored![A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditPlayerDeathText
[FarRight][LoadPlayer]
So... This is all it amounts[NL]
to, huh? Just...[.....][A][NL]
Failed dreams.[A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditVicarDeathText
[FarRight][LoadVicar]
So this is where it ends...[......][NL]
I fought for what I believe[A][NL]
in. I have no regrets...[A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditWalterDeathText
[FarRight][LoadWalter]
Is this... it? I see a light.[NL]
Vicar...[....] Thank you for[A][NL]
everything...[CloseEyes][......] Goodbye...[A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditBaretDeathText
[FarRight][LoadBaret]
Dammit. Here? Now? I'm sorry,[NL]
friends...[....] I'm of no[A][NL]
further use to you...[A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditAryaDeathText
[FarRight][LoadArya]
I knew this possibility existed.[NL]
Good luck, my friends...[....][A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditAdlezDeathText
[FarRight][LoadAdlez]
I may fall...[....] But[NL]
I still believe...[.....][A][NL]
Peace will be found...[....][A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditConnorDeathText
[FarRight][LoadConnor]
Damn... Damn, damn, damn![NL][CloseEyes]
Not like this...[A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditLeonDeathText
[FarRight][LoadLeon]
I may fall... But Haedric will[NL]
continue on...[....] Your war...[....][A][NL]
Is meaningless![A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditTalkXavusText
[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadXavus]
Why do you approach me? You should[NL]
know the futility of your efforts.[A]
[MidLeft]I know the futility of this entire[NL]
battle. I knew it going into this.[A]
[MidRight]Why did you seek to capture Bacrun then?[NL]
Your motivations... They seem irrational.[A]
[MidLeft]This war, between you and Cesaria... What's[NL]
the point? What do you seek? Power?[A][NL]
Forcing your power upon others is only[NL]
a form a weakness. It never works.[A]
[MidRight]You did this... To make a point?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course. Whether you take it or not is[NL]
up to you, I have nothing else to say.[A]
[MidRight]You've fought honorably. Unfortunately, I[NL]
cannot spare you. I do not know your name,[A][NL]
but I will speak highly of you after[NL]
this battle. Goodbye, Haedrician.[A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditTalkRexText
[MidRight][LoadPlayer][MidLeft][LoadRex]
You're one of the Haedricians...?[A]
[MidRight]Yes. You are General Rex, correct?[A]
[MidLeft]That would be me. Why[NL]
do you stop to talk?[A]
[MidRight]I know the futility of my efforts. The[NL]
point of this battle was not to win.[A]
[MidLeft]You had hoped to accomplish something...[NL]
Ah... Yes... I was wondering what reason[A][NL]
one would have for antagonizing[NL]
both us and Arcanae.[A]
[MidRight]We wanted you to be forced to work together.[NL]
This war has gone on long enough, with[A][NL]
little progress on either side. You know,[NL]
as I know, that it will not end[A][NL]
soon without a catalyst.[A]
[MidLeft]You sought to be that catalyst... Yes, I[NL]
see. I cannot make any gaurantees that[A][NL]
your ideals will come true, but I can at[NL]
the very least rpomise you that I will[A][NL]
remember this conversation well...[A]
[MidRight]Now, we are not here to[NL]
talk. En garde, General![A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditGoodEndingText
[MidLeft][LoadRex]
What a waste...[A]
[MidRight][LoadXavus]Basileus Leon... The whole Haedrician[NL]
army. What were they thinking?[A]
[MidLeft]Xavus! What are you doing here?[A]
[MidRight]Calm down Rex, the truce still stands.[A]
[MidLeft]Indeed... What is it you want?[A]
[MidRight]These men... They were smart. They had lives.[NL]
And they sacrificed themself. For what?[A]
[MidLeft]They died fighting in the name of[NL]
peace. To try and stop our war...[A]
[MidRight]Rex, I'd like us to enter into negotiations.[NL]
I believe that... We can reach a[A][NL]
compromise. Without wasting more lives.[A]
[MidLeft]Yes... I agree. I will notify the Emperor[NL]
and pull my forces back. I'd advise you[A][NL]
do the same. I will leave some men here[NL]
to aid in the reconstruction of Bacrun.[A]
[MidRight]As will I. I believe the Council has the[NL]
funds to handle it, they just need the[A][NL]
manpower... I will also pull back.[A]
[MidLeft]It is an agreement then. [Smile]I look forward to[NL]
finally resolving this, after so long.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Yes, I agree. I wish you luck on your end.[A][X]

[Left][CloseEyes][LoadPlayer]
So this is it...[....] I hope, perhaps...[....][NL]
They noticed our efforts...[....][A][X]

## Merc7BanditBanditNarratorText
[MidLeft][CloseEyes][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadNarrator]
What a waste...[A]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]Who...[....] are you?[A]
[MidRight]I am the one who gave you this[NL]
opportunity... And you squandered it.[A]
[MidLeft]I have...[....] A vague memory.[NL]
A blurry image...[A]
[MidRight]I am the Guardian Spirit. I gave you this[NL]
life, and what did you do? You wasted it. I[A][NL]
ought to leave you here for dead... But, I[NL]
have rules I must abide by. While it was[A][NL]
fun to watch what you did, as highly[NL]
disappointing as it was, my direct[A][NL]
intervention by giving you this life goes[NL]
against my oath. So, naturally, I must[A][NL]
kill you, and roll time back[NL]
to before your new life.[A]
[MidLeft]Just...[.....] Make it quick...[....][A]
[MidRight]Of course... Goodbye, [Tact].[A][X]

[CloseEyes]So I was just a pawn...[....][NL]
[Smile]Heh...[....] What an asshole...[A][X]
