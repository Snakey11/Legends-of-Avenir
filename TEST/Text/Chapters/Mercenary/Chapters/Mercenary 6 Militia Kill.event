[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadArc]Here they come.[Smile] Think[NL]
we can handle 'em?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course we can. Two of us, tons of them?[NL]
[Smile]They're outnumbered two to one.[A]
[MidRight][LoadArc]Hahaha! I like your thinking.[NL]
In the case this is the end...[A][NL]
It's been a blast, [Tact].[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Don't talk like that, Arc.[MidRight][Smile][MidLeft] There's too much[NL]
on the line here for us to fall here.[A]
[MidRight]Of course.[.....] You're right.[....] Can't[NL]
let myself think like that.[A]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadKendrick]The force that Luke and Arya are countering[NL]
seems to be much smaller than this[A][NL]
group. I don't know which one their captain[NL]
will be at, but you guys need the extra[A][NL]
help. I scouted their navy quickly as well.[NL]
All the soldiers came aground.[A]
[Left]The assistance is appreciated, Kendrick.[A]
[FarLeft]But of course. [Smile]Now let me at 'em![NL][Left][Smile][MidRight][Smile][FarLeft]
I haven't felt this alive[A][NL]
since my pirating days![A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillLukeHere
[FarRight][LoadLuke]Hey guys... *huff* Arya[NL]
sent me. She believes the other force[A][NL]
is a diversion to split us apart.[A]
[Left][LoadKendrick][FarLeft][LoadArc]Who the hell is Xexim that they[NL]
want him dead so badly?[A]
[FarRight][MoveRight]Arya mentioned something about Kilthel's[NL]
Four Orden. I wonder if it has to do[A][NL]
with the legend of Kilthel?[A]
[Left]Legend? You make a nice joke. Kilthel was[NL]
very real. The Four Orden were the[A][NL]
former guardian spirit's subordinates,[NL]
his four closest aids.[A]
[FarRight][LoadPlayer]Kendrick? How do you know this?[A]
[Left]I found a scroll depicting all of it back[NL]
when I... ah... used less accepted[A][NL]
business strategies. That's all I really know.[NL]
The identities of the Four Orden were[A][NL]
hidden, but I assumed they all died trying[NL]
to defend Kilthel's ideals, shortly[A][NL]
before Kilthel himself was ousted.[A]
[FarRight]I still don't get this whole[NL]
Guardian Spirit crap...[A]
[FarLeft]The Guardian Spirit basically controls[NL]
the Inge and Vene of the world. Nature[A][NL]
and magic. The two have to exist in perfect[NL]
harmony, or you get a wasteland like[A][NL]
Draterus where there once was[NL]
a great empire.[A]
[Right]He's very closely tied to the Higher[NL]
Beings. They almost act as his [A][NL]
servants, the Angels protecting Vene and[NL]
the Demons guarding Inge.[A][NL]
According to Arya, anyway.[A]
[Left]Kilthel wanted to change the cycle towards[NL]
the end of his days, and the Hero Efil put[A][NL]
a stop to him. But we don't have time to[NL]
contemplate... Here come more[A][NL]
of the Cesarian bastards![A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillAryaHere
[FarLeft][LoadArya]Their commander is coming.[FarRight][LoadPlayer][FarLeft] I took care[NL]
of the rest of them, but we have[A][NL]
to fend off this last group.[A]
[FarRight][MoveRight]Stop. Who is Xexim? There's more[NL]
than just the leader of Shizon to him.[A][NL]
I've heard too many references to a better[NL]
understanding of the higher beings,[A][NL]
and not just anyone can control the[NL]
Vathrylian guardians we fought [A][NL]
in the trial.[A]
[FarRight][LoadArc][FarLeft]He can explain himself after this battle,[NL]
but it won't do you any favors to[A][NL]
have the Cesarians get to him.[A]
[FarRight]Lay off her, [Tact].[NL]
She's right.[A]
[Right]Dammit... Very well.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][CloseSpeech]
[Pause]
[FarLeft][LoadJurgen]So this is the small band that's[NL]
destroyed my brigade. Of course I[A][NL]
have to handle things myself.[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]Captain Jurgen of the[NL]
Cesarian Lion Brigade...[A]
[Left][LoadLuke]Kendrick? Do you know him?[A]
[FarRight]He used to serve as the Lieutenant and[NL]
Vice-Captain under the current General,[A][NL]
Rex. He's very levelheaded and skilled. He[NL]
often led their navy against[A][NL]
me during my... ah... Old days.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArc][Left]So he'll be a bit of a challenge.[A]
[FarLeft]I doubt he'll try to[NL]
face us all by himself.[A]
[FarRight]You'd be right, there. He's always[NL]
been a cautious fighter. I bet if we[A][NL]
destroy enough of his troops, he'll retreat.[NL]
We won't be able to all gang up on[A][NL]
him, though. He'll keep his elite[NL]
soldiers by his side.[A]
[Right]It's fine. I've not met a group I feel[NL]
more comfortable fighting alongside[A][NL]
than you all. Let's do this.[A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillJurgenText
[FarLeft][LoadJurgen]All remaining units, attack! In the[NL]
name of Cesaria, we will succeed![A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillEndingText
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadXexim]Is it done?[A]
[Left][MoveRight]Yes. But they'll be back.[A]
[FarRight]Then we have no time to-[A]
[Pause]
[FarLeft][MoveLeft]Enough of this. There's something big[NL]
going on here. Big enough for[A][NL]
Cesaria to send[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left] an attack force[NL]
to Shizon. Who really are you,[A][NL]
Xexim? We almost died out there.[NL]
What's going on?[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Tact]![A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]Don't stop him Luke.[NL]
He's in the right.[A]
[FarRight]Yes, [Tact] is right.[NL]
I have no reason to hide who I am.[A]
[Left]Out with it.[A]
[Pause]
[FarRight]I am one of Kilthel's Four Orden. My[NL]
companions and I followed him in the[A][NL]
golden days. We were granted immortality and[NL]
a connection with the higher beings as[A][NL]
fragments of his power as Guardian Spirit. We[NL]
were ordered to assist him with his duty.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]Why are you still here, then?[A]
[FarRight]When Kilthel lost his way, my companions[NL]
assumed their duty was still with him. I[A][NL]
disagreed. Our duty was to uphold the morals[NL]
of the Guardian Spirit, not of Kilthel[A][NL]
himself. So I betrayed them. I aided Efil as[NL]
he killed my companions and Kilthel[A][NL]
himself. Do I regret it? No, I do not.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]You'd sooner betray your companions[NL]
than to corrupt your morals?[A]
[FarRight]There's more than morals on the line here.[NL]
Kilthel was risking an uprising of the[A][NL]
Higher Beings as it was. They have already[NL]
fallen out of custom on the[A][NL]
mainland of Avenir...[A]
[FarLeft]There are still those of[NL]
us that follow them![A]
[FarRight]You follow a corrupt set of ideals.[NL]
You have idealized them and glorified [A][NL]
them. They are just beings such as us.[NL]
Immortal and powerful, yes, but[A][NL]
certainly not the creators of the world.[NL]
Remember that they serve the[A][NL]
Guardian Spirit in the same way[NL]
you all serve your leaders.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]Ah, that is where the difference lies.[NL]
I man the wheel of my own ship.[A]
[Left]Yes...[.....] As do I.[A]
[FarRight]There are some exceptions. You are a[NL]
unique bunch, I'll give you that...[A][NL]
But we lack the time. Will you place[NL]
your trust in me, [Tact]?[A]
[Left]With all you've told? It's a lot to[NL]
take in. But yes. I trust you.[A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadArya]It's a lot for any Shizonian to learn[NL]
that we're essentially a[A][NL]
cult dedicated to old ways.[A]
[FarRight]You are not wrong. What about the[NL]
rest of you? Will you join me?[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Please. I wish to correct[NL]
the errors of my past.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]It will require some mulling over.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadKendrick]I said it before already, I man the[NL]
wheel of my own ship. I don't intend to[A][NL]
make any long-term commitments, but I have a[NL]
score to settle with Cesaria, and I[A][NL]
have a feeling you intend[NL]
to strike back.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]I'm with Kendrick on this one.[NL]
I'll aid you now.[A]
[FarRight]That is all I ask. Cesaria has[NL]
done me an injustice.[A]
[Left]What is it you need?[A]
[FarRight]We are going to go to the Cesarian[NL]
capital. I do not fault the emperor for[A][NL]
this desolation. No, the fault lies with the[NL]
military and General Rex. I do not wish[A][NL]
to promote full-scale war, but we are[NL]
Shizonians,[Smile] and we'll do what we do best.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]You want us to kill the[NL]
General of the Cesarian military?[A]
[ClearFace][LoadKendrick][Smile]Oh ho ho...[.....] This is gonna be more[NL]
fun than I ever thought.[A]
[Left]I wish to join your order. If this is what[NL]
you desire. [Smile]I will aid you, Xexim.[A]
[Right]As a Shizonian, I must follow with you.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]I am with [Tact].[NL]
I stand with Xexim.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]You're not seriously doing[NL]
this, Kendrick. Are you?[A]
[ClearFace][LoadKendrick]They'll need a ship to get there.[NL]
And I have a score to settle with them[A][NL]
myself. [Smile]Of course I'm going along.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc][Smile]Then I suppose there's no real decision[NL]
for me. [Smile]Why did Cesaria attack, anyway?[A]
[FarRight]Long has Shizon held an agreement with[NL]
Cesaria. So long as we are not dragged[A][NL]
into their wars, we will not unite against[NL]
them. The assassins of Shizon are some[A][NL]
of the most skilled on the planet, and[NL]
united, we would be a threat to[A][NL]
any of the nations.[A]
[Left]So they wanted to break the agreement?[A]
[FarRight]No. When Rex arose to the position of[NL]
General just a few years ago, he made his[A][NL]
views on the Higher Beings public. He[NL]
believes them to be false, an excuse[A][NL]
for war and a cheap explanation of the[NL]
reason for the differing[A][NL]
energies of the world.[A]
[FarLeft]You mean Inge and Vene?[A]
[FarRight]Yes. Unfortunately, this slowly escalated[NL]
into a heavy disagreement between he[A][NL]
and I. I never imagined it would have[NL]
escalated this far... He has shattered[A][NL]
our old agreement. Marching on Cesaria is[NL]
our only option now. We must kill Rex,[A][NL]
so that a new man will take his place and[NL]
perhaps return to the truth.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Are you saying that we're[NL]
basically a cult going to go kill[A][NL]
a guy who doesn't believe in us?[A]
[FarRight]Indeed.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Is this truly the way of[NL]
the Higher Beings?[A]
[FarRight]It is what they desire. Not for[NL]
reverence, but simply acknowledgement[A][NL]
of their existence. How would you feel if a[NL]
race sometime in the future denied the[A][NL]
existence of humanity? You would call[NL]
them a fool. It is no different.[A]
[Left]Very well. Let us accompany you. I[NL]
appreciate the honesty, and I'm[A][NL]
sure my companions do as well.[A]
[FarRight]Of course. Now let us go for[NL]
the capital of Cesaria,[A][NL]
and give our regards to General Rex.[A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillJurgenLeavesText
[FarLeft][LoadJurgen]Hmm... Pull out, men! Full retreat![A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillJurgenBattleText
[FarLeft][LoadJurgen]You attack me? Out of[NL]
confidence...? Or stupidity?[A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillJurgenDeathText
[FarLeft][LoadJurgen]Heh. [Smile]Never expected to[NL]
die in a place like this.[A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillHouse1Text
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan3]
I moved to Shizon to get away from the[NL]
mainland strife... Now it's found its[A][NL]
way here... Take this, and end this[NL]
fight. I want to get back to my peace.[A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillHouse2Text
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerWoman]
Cesarians? Here? I'm shocked... I[NL]
thought Xexim and General Rex had an[A][NL]
agreement. I see I was wrong... Shizon[NL]
will not stand for this. I'm not[A][NL]
a fighter, but I can give[NL]
this. It should help.[A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillHouse3Text
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerOldMan]
Shizon has not been attacked in eons...[NL]
Will today be the day our order fals?[A][NL]
I cannot join you on the battlefield,[NL]
but take this. It should help.[A][X]

## Merc6MilitiaKillHouse4Text
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadVillagerGirl1]
The Cesarians have come to defile the temple.[NL]
They have rejected the Higher Beings...[A][NL]
Like all of the Outer Lands, we of Shizon[NL]
are more in touch with the truth of these[A][NL]
deities than any other. You must not[NL]
let the Cesarians capture the temple.[A][X]
