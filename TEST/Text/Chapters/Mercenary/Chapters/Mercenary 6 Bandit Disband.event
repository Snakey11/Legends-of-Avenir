[FarLeft][LoadArya][Left][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadKendrick]
Ah, you're here! I have all the supplies we[NL]
should need for our excursion ready.[A][NL]
Whenever you're ready to head into[NL]
Draterus, we should be good.[A]
[Left]I think we're ready. Any objections?[A]
[FarLeft]None from me.[A][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
We're all ready.[A]
[MidRight]Very well. You said Temple of Kilthel[NL]
was your destination, right?[A][NL]
Interesting...[.....] Nobody's set[NL]
foot there for ten years.[A]
[Left]You want to know our goal?[A]
[MidRight]No, I'm just contemplating what[NL]
treasures we may be able to find.[A][NL]
Might as well get going, not much[NL]
reason to stick around here.[A]
[Left]Understandable. We're all[NL]
ready. Lead the way, Kendrick.[A]
[MidRight]My pleasure.[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandOutsideKilthelText
[FarLeft][LoadKendrick][Left][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadAdlez]
This is it... The Temple of Kilthel. Efil's[NL]
residence. Hopefully he'll help us.[A]
[FarLeft]So... Efil, huh? Interesting...[A]
[Left]Is there a problem, Kendrick?[A]
[FarLeft]No, not at all...[A]
[Pause]
[Right]Someone is coming...[A]
[Left]From where? I don't see anything.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadKendrick]Wanderers! Dammit![A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandWanderersOutsideText
[FarLeft][LoadKendrick][Right][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadAdlez][Left][LoadPlayer]
Get inside of the temple! Now![A]
[Right]I'll pull up the rear and make[NL]
sure everyone makes it in! Go![A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandInsideKilthelText
[FarLeft][LoadArya][Right][LoadVicar][Left][LoadPlayer]
Are we all here?[A]
[FarLeft]Looks like it. The Wanderers are out[NL]
there en masse, though. They'll probably[A][NL]
be storming in here any minute now...[A]
[Left]We'll have to find Efil, then.[NL]
Vicar, can you watch our back?[A]
[Right]Of course. Baret, Walter, you're with me.[A]
[FarRight][LoadBaret]Understood.[A][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
Okay...[A]
[Right]Everything okay, Walter?[A]
[FarRight]Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit of a rush[NL]
there. They appeared so suddenly...[A]
[Right]They did indeed... We'll have to keep a[NL]
sharp lookout. There's a good chance[A][NL]
there are many passages and areas in this[NL]
temple that we don't know about, but[A][NL]
the Wanderers do. We'll keep watch over[NL]
the main entrance, but stay safe.[A]
[Left]We will. Catch up quickly[NL]
if you have to, Vicar.[A]
[Right]Will do. Good luck finding Efil.[A][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[Left]So what do you know about this Temple,[NL]
Arya? The Shizonians seem to know a[A][NL]
lot more than the rest [FarRight][LoadKendrick][Left]of the world.[A]
[FarLeft]I don't know a lot, I'm afraid. Efil was[NL]
the hero who resolved the unbalance[A][NL]
between Vene, the magical energy of the world,[NL]
and Inge, the natural energy of the world.[A][NL]
This was supposedly the temple where it[NL]
came to a head between Efil and his allies[A][NL]
and the Guardian Spirit, Kilthel, but I[NL]
don't truly understand the conflict myself.[A]
[FarRight]The whole event had a very small impact[NL][Right][LoadAdlez][FarRight]
on most people's daily lives. It created a[A][NL]
temporary cease-fire between Arcanae and[NL]
Cesaria, but aside from that, most people[A][NL]
don't realize how close Avenir came to[NL]
becoming just one big desert.[A]
[Right]How do you know about it, Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight]I encountered Efil a few times on his[NL]
journey. [Smile]Plus, I make it my business to[A][NL]
know everybody else's business. The[NL]
more you know, the more you profit.[A]
[Left]Are you a businessman or a[NL]
criminal, Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight][LoadKendrick][Smile]I'm an honest businessman![NL]
[Smile]Just... a clever one.[A]
[Right]Any useful information you have[NL]
for us then, Mr. Pinnacle of Honesty?[A]
[FarRight]Efil has a strong sense of morality. He[NL]
doesn't want to intervene in the affairs[A][NL]
of the world if he doesn't have to. So he[NL]
stays all the way out here, in the middle[A][NL]
of nowhere. The Wanderers despise him,[NL]
though. It's possible they intend[A][NL]
to use us to have him lower his guard...[A]
[Left]What are they, anyway?[A]
[FarRight]The Wanderers? I don't really know. Arya?[A]
[FarLeft]I'm not the right one to ask either.[A]
[Right]I sure as hell don't know.[NL]
Probably a question for Efil.[A]
[Left]How do we find him, anyway?[A]
[FarLeft]Vathrylian Artifacts act as keys in their[NL]
temples. If we use the artifact we took[A][NL]
from Haedric, we should be able to open a[NL]
path to get out of this outer area.[A]
[FarRight]Artifact from Haedric?[A]
[Left]We stole an artifact from Haedric.[NL]
No, Kendrick, you can't have it.[A]
[FarRight]Damn, I was hopeful for a second there.[A]
[FarLeft]You didn't honestly think[NL]
we'd give it to you, right?[A]
[FarRight]I'm not an idiot. Besides, if that artifact[NL]
gets us into the inner temple, that gets us[A][NL]
closer to the potential treasures deeper[NL]
within this place. I've said I'm honest.[A]
[Right]Every "businessman" says that. On another[NL]
note, look there, at that wall.[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandWhatsThatSlotText
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadArya]
That's-[A]
[FarLeft]A slot in the wall?[A]
[Left]But we can't get there...[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandArtifactInsertionText
[MidRight][LoadPlayer]Looks like the artifact fits...[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandWallOpensText
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer]Incredible. Let's head deeper inside...[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandVicarWalterBaretHereText
[MidLeft][LoadArya][MidRight][LoadVicar]
You all might want to hurry.[NL]
The Wanderers are on their way.[A]
[MidLeft]We'd better find Efil, then. Quickly.[A][X]
	
## Merc6BanditDisbandWanderersHereText
[FarRight][LoadVicar][Right][LoadArya][FarLeft][LoadDaniel]I must thank you... You opened the[NL]
way to that heathen you call a "hero."[A]
[FarRight]Dammit... We'll have to[NL]
fight our way through them![A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandGuardiansInTheWayText
[FarRight][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadKendrick][Right][LoadArya]
Looks like there are some[NL]
leftover guardians here.[A]
[Left]Really? Maybe this was a bad idea...[A]
[FarRight]Guardians?[A]
[Right]The Vathrylians figured out how to[NL]
create lifeless soldiers for them. These[A][NL]
are the leftover remnants of their army.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadBaret]Enough chatter! We've[NL]
got Wanderers on our tail![A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandEfilHereText
[MidLeft][LoadEfil]
The Wanderers are here? This is...[....][NL]
unexpected. I suppose it is time for[A][NL]
me to put my sword arm back to use.[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandDanielHereText
[FarLeft][LoadDaniel]
Haha! Resistance is futile![NL]
[ToggleRed]Our numbers are endless![A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandDanielBattleText
[FarLeft][LoadDaniel]
I really must thank you for[NL]
letting us in here. Without[A]
that artifact, we wouldn't[NL]
have ever found a way in.[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandDanielDeathText
[FarLeft][LoadDaniel]
Of course I die in
this damned place...[A][X]

## Merc6BanditDisbandEndingText
[Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadAdlez][FarLeft][LoadEfil]
Are you the ones who opened the way in here?[A]
[Right]Yes. I'm sorry that the[NL]
Wanderers followed us in...[A]
[FarLeft]It's alright. We all emerged[NL]
unscathed, did we not?[A]
[Right]That's true...[A]
[FarLeft]But let's not stall. You must have[NL]
come here wanting something, no?[A]
[FarRight]That's right. There's[NL]
a war aboveground.[A]
[FarLeft]I know. Between Arcanae and Cesaria. I would[NL]
have hoped the conflict with Kilthel ten[A][NL]
years ago would have taught something.[A][Right][MoveLeft][Right][LoadKendrick]
Not everyone took that issue to heart, Efil.[A]
[FarLeft]Kendrick, is that you? Not like[NL]
you to be underground. I thought[A][NL]
you liked the open seas...[A]
[Right]I left that life behind me.[A]
[Left]You know Kendrick?[A]
[FarLeft]First, introductions. So,[NL]
who are the rest of you?[A]
[Left]I'm [Tact]. Just a freelancer.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
I'm Walter. I'm a mercenary under Vicar.[A][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
Baret. Same as Walter.[A][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
I'm Vicar, the leader of my[NL]
small group of mercenaries.[A]
[FarLeft]You must all be from Haedric, then?[A][Right][ClearFace][LoadArya]
Not me. I'm Arya, a Shizonian[NL]
in service to Adlez.[A]
[FarLeft]A Shizonian, eh? One of Xexim's bunch?[A]
[Right]How do you know Xexim?[A]
[FarLeft]I got around in my journeys. Anyone who[NL]
needs information knows the Lord of[A][NL]
Shizon is a good place to go.[A]
[Right]He's not a Lord. Just our leader.[A]
[FarLeft]Yes, yes, I know. I take[NL]
it you must be Adlez, then?[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadAdlez]
Yes. I'm a former bandit leader, but this all[NL]
was my idea. We tire of the war between[A][NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae. We've been searching[NL]
for a way to intervene, and this seems[A][NL]
like the most realistic option.[A]
[FarLeft]Realistic option? Who do you think[NL]
I am, a god? I am just a man, no[A][NL]
different from any other man.[A]
[FarRight]Yes, but you're respected among their[NL]
leaders! If you come with us,[A][NL]
we can reason with them![A]
[FarLeft]You grossly overestimate my influence. I[NL]
may be the one associated with stopping[A][NL]
Kilthel, but it wasn't just me. If the others[NL]
who journeyed with me chose to forget[A][NL]
why we fought, that is their problem.[A]
[FarRight]But it's become our problem too![NL]
International trade is being disrupted,[A][NL]
Haedric is being torn in two trying to decide[NL]
whether to remain neutral or join the[A][NL]
conflict! If something isn't done, then stopping[NL]
Kilthel ten years ago won't have mattered.[A]
[FarLeft]But you see-[A][Right][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]
Efil, I've seen it up there too. We weren't[NL]
exactly friends ten years ago, but you[A][NL]
have to be realistic. People are dying. You[NL]
stopped Kilthel to prevent that. Are you[A][NL]
seriously just going to sit here and pretend[NL]
it's any different? So what if it happens[A][NL]
all at once or over the course of one hundred[NL]
years? It's a lot of death either way.[A]
[FarLeft]Kendrick... You really aren't the marauding[NL]
pirate you were ten years ago, are you?[A]
[FarRight]Pirate!?[A]
[Right]Honest.[....] Businessman.[A]
[FarLeft]Hahah! Still have a bit of a sense of humor[NL]
though. In all seriousness, I would love[A][NL]
to help you, Adlez, but I don't think I can.[A]
[Left]Talk to your friends.[A]
[FarLeft]Excuse me?[A]
[Left]You said you had help when[NL]
you stopped Kilthel, right?[A]
[FarLeft]Well... Of course.[NL]
There were many of us.[A]
[Left]You hinted that some of them hold noteworthy[NL]
positions in Avenir. Do they?[A]
[FarLeft]Ye-es...[A]
[Left]So talk to them. If not that, meet them on[NL]
the battlefield. They know you wouldn't[A][NL]
show yourself unless it truly meant[A][NL]
something. Seeing you fighting to stop them[NL]
would certainly rouse them, right?[A]
[FarRight][Tact], are you saying we meet[NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae in battle?[A][Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
That's exactly what I'm saying. On[NL]
the border. We're all strong[A][NL]
fighters, we can fend for ourselves.[A]
[FarLeft]You might have an idea there, [Tact]...[NL]
Very well. Allow me to organize myself. I[A][NL]
advise all of you to do the same. Tomorrow,[NL]
we move south, towards the border of Arcanae[NL]
and Cesaria. I imagine there are often[A][NL]
skirmishes there. If we find ourselves in the[NL]
middle of one, its the chance we need.[A]
[FarRight]Are you sure about this?[A]
[FarLeft]I had forgotten myself. I apologize. Peace[NL]
is more necessary than my vow to retreat[A][NL]
from Avenir's affairs. Thank you all. I will[NL]
see you tomorrow when we move out.[A][X]
