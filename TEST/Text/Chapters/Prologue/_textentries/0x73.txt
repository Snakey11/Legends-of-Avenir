[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]Arcanae is the center of all magic in Avenir.[....][NL]
The capital is separated into five[A][NL]
districts,[.] each ruled by one of the Grand Magi.[.....][NL]
Their primary concern is always research[A][NL]
and advancement,[.] and each of the Grand Magi[NL]
draws the line of what is necessary and[A][NL]
what isn't necessary in a different place.[.....][NL]
Additionally,[.] each one of them has[A][NL]
their own small army.[.....] Arcanae almost functions[NL]
as five independent states,[.] united by[A][NL]
their mutual knowledge and power. [.....]Anything[NL]
affecting all five states has to be voted[A][NL]
on and discussed by the Five Grand Magi.[.....][NL]
Of course,[.] each one specializes[A][NL]
in a different form of magic. Mistlain[NL]
studies Fire,[.] Xavus studies Dark,[A][NL]
Alexis studies Light,[.] Muriel studies Wind,[NL]
and Uzkalis studies thunder.[......] Each[A][NL]

for their dedication to their position[A][NL]
as Magus.[A][X]
