[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]Oh, what have we here?[NL]
Another lost spirit? Typical.[A][NL]
Always coming here to the[NL]
realm of the Guardian Spirit.[A][NL]
You don't know what that is?[NL]
It's a parallel dimension,[A][NL]
where the guardians of the current era watch[NL]
and control the balance of the world.[A][NL]
We also cater to you lost spirits so[NL]
you may get back to your true world.[A][NL]
What? You don't know about[NL]
the world you're in?[A][NL]
I should cover that before getting to work.[NL]
This is Avenir. It is separated into[A][NL]
multiple countries on the main landmass,[NL]
surrounded by the Outer Lands[A][NL]
that very few people ever travel to,[NL]
the most notable of which[A][NL]
being the assassin dynasty of Shizon.[NL]
To the southwest lies the empire[A][NL]
of Cesaria, noted for their very strong[NL]
military. The Emperor and General work[A][NL]
together to rule the country.[NL]
To the east of them is Arcanae,[A][NL]
a country entirely based around magic,[.][NL]
ruled by their council of the Five[A][NL]
Grand Magi. Just north of Arcanae is Haedric,[NL]
a warrior nation ruled by the Basileus.[A][NL]
Their law is maintained by Warlords[NL]
who command small clans, but[A][NL]
they are fiercely loyal to the Basileus.[NL]
Within the long mountain range at the[A][NL]
north of the continent are the fliers of Altia.[NL]
Their Dragon Lord and High Priest rule.[A][NL]
In the center is the desert of Draterus[NL]
where nobody is known to inhabit,[A][NL]
but it was once the legendary Vathrylian[NL]
empire before they destroyed themselves.[A][NL]
There is also the small state of Bacrun just[NL]
east of Draterus between Arcanae[A][NL]
and Haedric. [.....]Most trade between[NL]
the countries flows through there.[NL][A]
Now that you have a basic[NL]
understanding of the world[A][NL]
you're about to inhabit,[NL]
what is your name?[A][X]
