You want to try and get Leon on our side?[A]
[Right]That's the short of it, yes. I[NL]
think he could see what we're[A][NL]
trying to accomplish here.[A]
[Left]It's far-fetched.[A]
[FarLeft]Shizon has spies around the continent. Leon[NL]
would rather have all of Avenir under[A][NL]
Haedric's control than to see Cesaria or[NL]
Arcanae win the war. If he had this[A][NL]
artifact and support from the bandit clan,[A][NL]
it's very likely he could support us.[A]
[FarRight]Face it, Connor, we have no hope of[NL]
taking on all three countries ourselves.[A]
[Left]But the artifact's power...[A]
[Right]I am the leader of this clan, Connor. I[NL]
am with [Tact] and Arya on this matter.[A]
[Left]Boss...[A]
[Right]I've already dispatched someone to contact[NL]
Leon. They should be returning soon.[A]
[Left]I see. Very well. No reason to create[NL]
unnecessary divide. You're the boss, boss.[A]
[Right]Get some rest, everybody. We should[NL]
have Leon's response in the morning.[A][X]
