Elanil, I'm relying on you to show us[NL]
the way. You know these lands well.[A]
[Right]Of course. I'll do my best.[A]
[FarRight]I'll keep an eye out from the skies.[NL]
It should be hard for Cesarians to ambush[A][NL]
us. The weather looks fairly clear, so I[NL]
wouldn't be too concerned about avalanches.[A][ClearFace][....][LoadVal]
This cold is so very unlike home...[A]
[MidLeft]Is it warm in Arcanae?[A]
[FarRight]Much more so than here, at least. Aside[NL]
from Draterus, we're often considered the[A][NL]
warmest and driest climate in Avenir.[A][NL][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadHelmer]
It's because of the large concentration of[NL]
Vene that allows the magic to function.[A][NL]
It saps away at nature, leaving the land[NL]
more barren than places like Haedric.[A][NL]
But not as barren as Draterus.[A][CloseSpeech][Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
You seem to have a good knowledge[NL]
of this stuff, Helmer.[A]
[FarLeft]I originally trained to become a mage,[NL]
but failed at performing the magic[A][NL]
itself. I know all the theory behind it,[NL]
but can't tap into Vene myself.[A][NL]
Hence why I'm just a simple spearman.[A]
[Right]Interesting. You're in good company here,[NL]
though, travelling with Haedricians.[A]
[FarLeft]This is very true. My loyalty is[NL]
bound to Arcanae all the same.[A]
[Left][ClearFace][LoadElanil]We're reaching the base of the pass.[NL]
There's a small border town here, but[A][NL]
it doesn't owe any allegiance to Cesaria.[NL]
They likely will do whatever it takes[A][NL]
to maintain their autonomy.[A]
[FarRight]I never understood the concept of these[NL]
city-states. In Arcanae, everything is[A][NL]
under rule of the Magi, who serve[NL]
as governors in their districts.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]
It's like Bacrun, except Bacrun is just so[NL]
big that they're almost their own empire.[A]
[FarRight]I suppose... I hadn't thought[NL]
about it that way. Well...[A][NL]
Either they're with us or against us.[A]
[Left]It's not that simple.[NL]
We'll handle the talking.[A][ClearFace][LoadHelmer]
Don't worry about it, Val. We're working[NL]
with these people, not against them.[A]
[Right]Arc, stay back with them. Finoc is likely[NL]
still scouting out. He should return[A][NL]
soon. Luke and Elanil, let's go and speak[NL]
to whoever runs this place.[A][NL]
Hopefully we can come to an agreement.[A]
[FarLeft]Will do. Good luck.[A][X]
