[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadArya][MidRight][LoadXexim]I cannot help you from here. Your task is to[NL]
eliminate the foe, but also to discover[A][NL]
who they are. Good luck. I've got big[NL]
problems of my own to deal with.[A]
[FarLeft]Thank you, Xexim.[A][MidRight][ClearFace]
[Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadArya]Don't thank him yet.[NL]
We've got this task to get to.[A][FarLeft][MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke]Haven't you done this before, Arya?[A]
[Right][TMM]...[TMM][.......] Not[TMM]...[TMM][.....] exactly.[NL]
This isn't actually the trial to become[A][NL]
one of us. It is the trial of judgement upon[NL]
outsiders that come here. You are only[A][NL]
worthy to set foot in Shizon[NL]
by passing this test.[A]
[FarRight][LoadArc][Smile]Regardless, we're doing this[NL]
blind? That's fine by me![A]
[Left][Smile]Let's do it.[A][X]
