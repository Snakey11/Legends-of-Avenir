So what is the deal with you two? You've[NL]
been friends for awhile. I can tell that.[A]
[Right]I was born in Cesaria. I enlisted in the[NL]
military academy and pursued a position[A][NL]
in the military. The former general took a[NL]
shining to me, and I was promoted to[A][NL]
Lieutenant and appointed Vice Captain of the[NL]
Puma Brigade to my great surprise. When[A][NL]
the former general, Leyos, used us as fodder[NL]
in the last war with Arcanae, the one that[A][NL]
was resolved by the hero known as Efil, I[NL]
deserted and went to Arcanae. I was the[A][NL]
youngest Vice Captain ever appointed at[NL]
just seventeen. I met Val in a border[A][NL]
town, where she lived.[A]
[FarRight]That's where my side of the story starts.[NL]
I had grown up in that town. Helmer[A][NL]
and I both enlisted in the Arcanian[NL]
academy. I thought he just didn't[A][NL]
have the aptitude for magic. I[NL]
never realized he was a Cesarian.[A]
[Right]I am an Arcanian. I turned my back on the[NL]
country that turned its back on me.[A]
[MidLeft]So what happened?[A]
[FarRight]Our... Well, my... Village was destroyed.[NL]
My family was killed. Helmer and I were[A][NL]
the only two to escape. From that point[NL]
on, I trusted him with my life. I[A][NL]
never realized what he was hiding...[A]
[Right]I'm sorry, Val...[A]
[FarRight]It... doesn't matter.[A]
[MidLeft]It's the past, Val. You can't blame him[NL]
for where he was born and grew up.[A][NL]
I'll leave this to you two to sort[NL]
out. I have a General to speak to.[A][X]
