[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadVicar][FarRight][LoadAdlez]
Ah, you've all returned. I take[NL]
it the men I sent are dead?[A]
[Left]Killed before we got there. Haedricians[NL]
are a tough breed, even militiamen.[A]
[FarRight]I see. They knew the chances were[NL]
there... I appreciate you returning[A][NL]
with some of the cut, even if you[NL]
are just mercenaries.[A]
[Left]You tipped us off to the[NL]
raid. It was only fair.[A]
[FarRight]So, [Tact], what did you think of your[NL]
first experience working for a bandit chief?[A]
[FarLeft]It was different than what I[NL]
expected. I didn't realize there[A][NL]
was so much senseless killing.[A]
[Right][LoadBaret]Still hung up on that?[A][Left][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
Lay off him, Baret. We used to have[NL]
his same morals too, you know.[A]
[Right]I doubt we'll be seeing much[NL]
more of him anyway.[A][Left][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
If you don't mind, Adlez, I think we'll be[NL]
using some spare cots here for the night?[A]
[FarRight]That's perfectly fine. [Tact],[NL]
do you mind if I speak with you?[A]
[FarLeft]Not at all.[A]
[Left]We'll take our leave.[A][ClearFace][Right][ClearFace][FarRight][CloseSpeech][MoveMidRight]
Thank you again, Vicar. [Tact], tell[NL]
me about yourself. Why did you[A][NL]
want to join us on the raid?[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft][LoadPlayer]
Well... I wanted to see what it was like.[NL]
With the war going on, most of my jobs are[A][NL]
becoming more dangerous and less well-paying.[NL]
I thought it was worth a shot.[A]
[MidRight]I see... Well, my group could definitely[NL]
use a fighter like you. Let me introduce[A][NL]
you to my right-hand man, Connor.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadConnor]
[MidLeft]You're Connor?[A]
[FarRight]Yeah. I keep track of the men and make sure[NL]
raids are carried out cleanly and[A][NL]
successfully. You see, we have a[NL]
plan that's bigger than just being[A][NL]
criminals, and you would[NL]
be a perfect addition.[A]
[MidLeft]What exactly does it entail...?[A]
[FarRight]We want to take over Haedric. From[NL]
there, move towards Arcanae and Cesaria.[A][NL]
This whole continent needs to be united[NL]
in order to restore the old peace,[A][NL]
even if we have to kill every[NL]
person in power to do it.[A]
[Right]But for now, we're just building up our[NL]
ranks. You're cut above the average man.[A][NL]
Vicar and the brothers are as well...[A]
[FarRight]...[.....] But we know Vicar's leadership[NL]
would conflict with ours. If this is[A][NL]
gonna happen, we want you to[NL]
command them. But... subtly.[A]
[MidLeft]What's in this for me?[A]
[Right]A governor position in the new empire we[NL]
seek to create. Money. Power.[A][NL]
Whatever you want, really.[A]
[MidLeft]...[......] I'm in. I'll[NL]
join your clan, Adlez.[A]
[Right]Very good... Now, there's a shipment sent[NL]
from the Basileus of Haedric to the[A][NL]
merchant city-state, Bacrun. We believe[NL]
there are crucial documents and[A][NL]
artifacts in it that could come in handy.[A]
[FarRight]I've been making arrangements with a[NL]
Shizonian assassin to join your group[A][NL]
on this mission. You'll be fighting real[NL]
Haedrician warriors, so be cautious.[A]
[MidLeft]I understand. Thank you for[NL]
the forewarning. Is that all?[A]
[Right]Yes. Connor will show you all to[NL]
the ambush point tomorrow morning.[A][NL]
In the meantime, get your rest.[A][X]
