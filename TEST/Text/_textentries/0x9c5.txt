They're coming. This is it.[A]
[Right]So we face the end of our days. I never[NL]
thought it would be here, of all places...[A]
[MidLeft]Ten years ago was the last time I stood[NL]
in these halls, as an attacker... Now[A][NL]
I defend the life of my Emperor.[A]
[FarRight]Maximus... Leyos... I can't thank you enough[NL]
for all you have done for Cesaria. You do not[NL]
need to sacrifice yourselves on my account.[A]
[MidLeft]Sorry, my lord. It's our duty.[A]
[Right]I dedicated my life to serving your[NL]
father, and now you. I'd rather[A][NL]
die than be robbed of that duty.[A]
[MidLeft]I ask you now to hide. Allow Leyos[NL]
and I to fend off Uzkalis and his[A][NL]
followers. Perhaps you will[NL]
have a chance to live.[A]
[FarRight]I will not run, however. If this is the[NL]
end of Cesaria, I go with it.[A][NL]
May I address the soldiers?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course.[A][ClearFace][FarRight][MoveRight]
Men of the Tiger Brigade![FarLeft][LoadSoldier2][Left][LoadSoldier5][Right][.....][NL]
Today, we face a great crossroads in our[A][NL]
empire. We either face the dusk, or the[NL]
dawn. But what will it be? That fate lies[A][NL]
on your shoulders. If we die here, it is in[NL]
honor! They will remember us! For better or[A][NL]
for worse, here we stand! I look out at your[NL]
faces, and I see good men. Honorable men.[A][NL]
There is nobody else I would rather die beside![NL]
For we are all Cesarians, regardless of[A][NL]
title! And we will not be silenced![A]
[Left]Aye! All hail his lord,[NL]
the Emperor of Cesaria![A]
[FarLeft]It is an honor to fight defending you![A][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][FarRight]
You did well, my lord. Now we must go.[NL]
Maximus will command the front lines.[A][NL]
We must stay back, and take an opportunity[NL]
to escape if it exists, though there[A][NL]
is only one exit.[A]
[Right]It's fine, Leyos. I wish to watch.[A]
[FarRight]Stay in the back, at least. I do not[NL]
wish for you to die as long as I stand.[A]
[Right]Very well.[A][X]
