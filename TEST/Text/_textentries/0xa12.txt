[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadAdlez][FarRight][LoadMayor][Right][LoadTyrone]
This is it... [CloseEyes][.....]The mayor. Where is he?[A]
[FarRight]I'm here, Warlord Tyrone.[A]
[Right]I leave the matter of the artifact...[....][NL]
to you. You can trust...[.....] Adlez...[A]
[Left]Tyrone...[A]
[Right]Adlez... It is all fine[NL]
now. I do not blame you.[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight]Why did you kill him?[A]
[FarLeft]He stood in our way. It[NL]
didn't have to be this way.[A]
[FarRight]What do you want from us?[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveLeft]
The artifact. The original plan laid out by[NL]
Adlez' right hand man had us conquering[A][NL]
Haedric, but it was foolishness...[NL]
I think we can work together.[A]
[FarRight]You've killed Warlord Tyrone.[A]
[FarLeft]He was stubborn. He knew the chance was[NL]
there. My right-hand man, Connor... He[A][NL]
has ambitions for more than[NL]
peace. He wants to rule.[A]
[FarRight]And you desire something different!?[A]
[FarLeft]Yes. I believe the only one capable of[NL]
resolving the dispute between Arcanae and[A][NL]
Cesaria is Efil, the hero of the conflict[NL]
ten years ago. He should still reside in[A][NL]
the Temple of Kilthel in Draterus, but[NL]
we need an artifact to reach him.[A]
[FarRight]And you think this artifact will suffice?[A]
[Left]Yes, we do.[A]
[FarRight]Why should I trust you?[NL]
You murdered Tyrone.[A]
[Left]You have no reason to trust us. But we[NL]
did spare you. It would have been easy for[A][NL]
us to kill you and take it by force[A]
[FarLeft]As I said, Tyrone is stubborn. He[NL]
wouldn't have listened to us.[A]
[FarRight]Tyrone... Well, I suppose if I refuse,[NL]
you'll kill me. So I really have no choice.[A][NL]
Take the artifact and go to Draterus.[A]
[Left][Smile][FarLeft][Smile]You can tell the Basileus that our bandit[NL]
clan killed Tyrone. When he moves against[A][NL]
our headquarters, Connor will be the only[NL]
one there, and as we said, his ideals[A][NL]
are very different from ours.[A]
[FarRight]Very well. I wish you all luck...[A]
[Left]Thank you, sir.[A][X]
