[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadArc]Here they come.[Smile] Think[NL]
we can handle 'em?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course we can. Two of us, tons of them?[NL]
[Smile]They're outnumbered two to one.[A]
[MidRight][LoadArc]Hahaha! I like your thinking.[NL]
In the case this is the end...[A][NL]
It's been a blast, [Tact].[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Don't talk like that, Arc.[MidRight][Smile][MidLeft] There's too much[NL]
on the line here for us to fall here.[A]
[MidRight]Of course.[.....] You're right.[....] Can't[NL]
let myself think like that.[A]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadKendrick]The force that Luke and Arya are countering[NL]
seems to be much smaller than this[A][NL]
group. I don't know which one their captain[NL]
will be at, but you guys need the extra[A][NL]
help. I scouted their navy quickly as well.[NL]
All the soldiers came aground.[A]
[Left]The assistance is appreciated, Kendrick.[A]
[FarLeft]But of course. [Smile]Now let me at 'em![NL][Left][Smile][MidRight][Smile][FarLeft]
I haven't felt this alive[A][NL]
since my pirating days![A][X]
