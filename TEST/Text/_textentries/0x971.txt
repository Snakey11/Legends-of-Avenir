[FarRight][LoadLuke]Hey guys... *huff* Arya[NL]
sent me. She believes the other force[A][NL]
is a diversion to split us apart.[A]
[Left][LoadKendrick][FarLeft][LoadArc]Who the hell is Xexim that they[NL]
want him dead so badly?[A]
[FarRight][MoveRight]Arya mentioned something about Kilthel's[NL]
Four Orden. I wonder if it has to do[A][NL]
with the legend of Kilthel?[A]
[Left]Legend? You make a nice joke. Kilthel was[NL]
very real. The Four Orden were the[A][NL]
former guardian spirit's subordinates,[NL]
his four closest aids.[A]
[FarRight][LoadPlayer]Kendrick? How do you know this?[A]
[Left]I found a scroll depicting all of it back[NL]
when I... ah... used less accepted[A][NL]
business strategies. That's all I really know.[NL]
The identities of the Four Orden were[A][NL]
hidden, but I assumed they all died trying[NL]
to defend Kilthel's ideals, shortly[A][NL]
before Kilthel himself was ousted.[A]
[FarRight]I still don't get this whole[NL]
Guardian Spirit crap...[A]
[FarLeft]The Guardian Spirit basically controls[NL]
the Inge and Vene of the world. Nature[A][NL]
and magic. The two have to exist in perfect[NL]
harmony, or you get a wasteland like[A][NL]
Draterus where there once was[NL]
a great empire.[A]
[Right]He's very closely tied to the Higher[NL]
Beings. They almost act as his [A][NL]
servants, the Angels protecting Vene and[NL]
the Demons guarding Inge.[A][NL]
According to Arya, anyway.[A]
[Left]Kilthel wanted to change the cycle towards[NL]
the end of his days, and the Hero Efil put[A][NL]
a stop to him. But we don't have time to[NL]
contemplate... Here come more[A][NL]
of the Cesarian bastards![A][X]
