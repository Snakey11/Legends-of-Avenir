[FarRight][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadBaret]
Stay out my way, [Tact].[A]
[FarRight]I'd say the same to you. I'm just[NL]
here to loot, then I'm disappearing.[A]
[Right]Just don't hesitate to kill if you have[NL]
to. These may be militiamen, but[A][NL]
they're still Haedricians. They'll[NL]
give you a run for your money.[A]
[FarRight]I think I can handle myself...[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArc]More bandits?[A]
[Right]You killed Gerwick. We're[NL]
here to return the favor.[A]
[FarLeft]We may have been caught off guard by[NL]
Gerwick, but do not underestimate[A][NL]
our full strength. Leave here now[NL]
with your lives. No one has to die.[A]
[Right]No. You leave here. This town is ours.[A]
[FarLeft]Men of Danaan! To arms! We'll die before[NL]
we let you destroy our home.[A][X]
