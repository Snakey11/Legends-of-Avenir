Well done, Lux. I appreciate the support.[A]
[Right]Thank you, Captain. But credit must go where[NL]
it is due. [Tact] was brilliant. I'm not[A][NL]
sure we could have done it without[NL]
the aid from him and his friends.[A]
[MidLeft]I simply did what was right.[A]
[FarRight]Even so. Let us set out for Bacrun. It's[NL]
the nearest cililized area, and I need[A][NL]
to contact General Rex. Rookies![A][MidLeft][ClearFace][Left][LoadDerek]
Sir![A][FarLeft][LoadJasper]
Reporting for duty![A]
[FarRight]You've done well the past few days.[NL]
I'll see to it you receive appropriate[A][NL]
honors for your duty.[A]
[Left]Thank you sir![A]
[FarRight]For now, escort [Tact] and his friends[NL]
to the capital. I plan to take Lux and[A][NL]
the remains of the brigade to assist[NL]
Jurgen with his assault.[A]
[FarLeft]Understood sir![A]
[Pause]
[ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][....][FarRight][ClearFace][Left][LoadElanil][FarLeft][LoadFinoc]
I believe this is where Elanil[NL][FarRight][LoadPlayer][FarLeft]
and I must bid you all adieu.[A]
[FarRight]Finoc?[A]
[Left]We have to report to our leaders in Altia.[NL]
They have been anxiously awaiting news[A][NL]
surrounding the fate of Uzkalis.[A]
[FarRight]Ah, I understand. [Smile]I'll be sure to[NL]
visit you all in the future, after[A][NL]
this war comes to its close.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]I look forward to it, [Tact].[A]
[Left][Smile]As do I. Make sure to bring layers[NL]
though. It gets chilly up there.[A]
[FarRight]I'll be sure to.[A][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][MidLeft][LoadLuke]
Captain Maximus! I wish to go with you.[NL]
I want to see firsthand this war, and[FarRight][LoadMaximus][MidLeft][A][NL]
perhaps help Arcanae with their[NL]
reconstruction after it is done...[A]
[FarRight]Lux?[A]
[Right]I've seen Luke's abilities firsthand. He's[NL]
a kind soul and will be good to have.[A]
[FarRight]Very well then. If my Vice-Captain[NL]
is convinced, I'm convinced.[A][MidLeft][ClearFace][Right][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
What about you, Arc?[A]
[MidLeft][LoadArc]I'm heading back to Haedric. I want[NL]
to meet with Basileus Leon. What happened[A][NL]
to Danaan... It can't happen again. We need[NL]
to be more organized. We'll need it.[A]
[Right]A good cause. Until we[NL]
meet again, friend.[A][MidLeft][ClearFace][FarLeft][LoadJasper][Left][LoadDerek]
Do you wish to go to[NL]
the capital, [Tact]?[A]
[FarRight]I think so. Lead the way.[A]
I'll scout ahead and bring word to[NL]
General Rex and the Emperor first.[A]
[FarRight]A good idea. Let's rest first.[A]
[Right]Godspeed, friend.[A][X]
