There it is. The Shining City of Nitens,[NL]
the capital of Cesaria. Within lies the[A][NL]
Emperor, defended by General Rex and the[NL]
Dragon Brigade. I'm sure Maximus and his[A][NL]
Tiger Brigade are somewhere around too.[A]
[Right]Elanil, Val. Can you two scout ahead?[A]
[FarRight]Will do.[A]
[FarLeft]Understood.[A][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadFinoc][Right]
Helmer, what all do you[NL]
know about Cesaria?[A]
[Left]Well, for starters, they're[NL]
one of three countries in[A][NL]
Avenir with an organized military.[A]
[FarRight]What do you mean?[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArc]I can answer that. Haedric doesn't technically[NL]
have a military. There's little to no[A][NL]
organization. We guard our own lands[NL]
fiercely, and because of that,[A][NL]
Haedric remains safe.[A]
[FarRight]You defend the parts rather than the[NL]
whole... Interesting. Altia is much[A][NL]
smaller, and our military matches that.[A]
[Left]Correct. Altia has a really organized army,[NL]
seperated into the fliers, archers, and[A][NL]
fire mages. Arcanae's Five Magi each uphold[NL]
their own military, though each handles[A][NL]
it differently. Xavus and Uzkalis have united[NL]
theirs, Alexis doesn't keep one, Mistlain[A][NL]
and Muriel prefer just their small group of[NL]
bodyguards. Hence why we were so[A][NL]
easily able to seize power.[A]
[FarRight]So how does Cesaria handle it?[A]
[Left]It's a hierarchy, essentially. The General,[NL]
Rex, may assume command of any brigade[A][NL]
he desires at any point. He himself personally[NL]
commands the Dragon Brigade, serving as[A][NL]
the royal guard to the Emperor. Each other[NL]
brigade is commanded by a Captain[A][NL]
and their Vice-Captain.[A]
[Right]How many brigades are there?[A]
[Left]Rex commands the Dragon Brigade, Maximus[NL]
commands the Tiger Brigade. Additionally,[A][NL]
Jurgen commands the Lion Brigade, which he[NL]
took command of after Rex filled the[A][NL]
position of General about ten years ago.[NL]
There's also rumors of a Cheetah Brigade,[A][NL]
led by Captain Zalius, better known as the[NL]
dark sword. They are all specially[A][NL]
trained as information gatherers, spies,[NL]
and skilled one-on-one fighters,[A][NL]
similar to Haedrician Warriors.[A]
[FarLeft]We should be able to assume at least one[NL]
of the brigades is diverted to Xavus'[A][NL]
attack on the eastern front.[A]
[Left]That's fair. I'd almost argue more than[NL]
one, solely because there was only a[A][NL]
small chance of our attack. I hope we made[NL]
it here in time to avoid conflict[A][NL]
with too many Cesarian troops.[A]
[Right]We moved quickly from the border. We don't[NL]
even know for sure if people watched the[A][NL]
battle to send word ahead. Let's wait[NL]
for Elanil and Val to return.[A]
[Left]Agreed.[A]
[FarLeft]I'll get some rest while we wait. I'll[NL]
need energy for the coming battle.[A]
[Right]Go ahead, Arc. [Smile]I've been dragging you[NL]
in circles around Avenir,[A][NL]
you deserve the rest.[A]
[Left]I'll go ahead and keep watch. You[NL]
get some rest too, [Tact].[A]
[Right]Thank you, Helmer.[A][X]
