[FarLeft][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadArya][FarRight][LoadXexim]Is it done?[A]
[Left][MoveRight]Yes. But they'll be back.[A]
[FarRight]Then we have no time to-[A]
[Pause]
[FarLeft][MoveLeft]Enough of this. There's something big[NL]
going on here. Big enough for[A][NL]
Cesaria to send[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left] an attack force[NL]
to Shizon. Who really are you,[A][NL]
Xexim? We almost died out there.[NL]
What's going on?[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Tact]![A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]Don't stop him Luke.[NL]
He's in the right.[A]
[FarRight]Yes, [Tact] is right.[NL]
I have no reason to hide who I am.[A]
[Left]Out with it.[A]
[Pause]
[FarRight]I am one of Kilthel's Four Orden. My[NL]
companions and I followed him in the[A][NL]
golden days. We were granted immortality and[NL]
a connection with the higher beings as[A][NL]
fragments of his power as Guardian Spirit. We[NL]
were ordered to assist him with his duty.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]Why are you still here, then?[A]
[FarRight]When Kilthel lost his way, my companions[NL]
assumed their duty was still with him. I[A][NL]
disagreed. Our duty was to uphold the morals[NL]
of the Guardian Spirit, not of Kilthel[A][NL]
himself. So I betrayed them. I aided Efil as[NL]
he killed my companions and Kilthel[A][NL]
himself. Do I regret it? No, I do not.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]You'd sooner betray your companions[NL]
than to corrupt your morals?[A]
[FarRight]There's more than morals on the line here.[NL]
Kilthel was risking an uprising of the[A][NL]
Higher Beings as it was. They have already[NL]
fallen out of custom on the[A][NL]
mainland of Avenir...[A]
[FarLeft]There are still those of[NL]
us that follow them![A]
[FarRight]You follow a corrupt set of ideals.[NL]
You have idealized them and glorified [A][NL]
them. They are just beings such as us.[NL]
Immortal and powerful, yes, but[A][NL]
certainly not the creators of the world.[NL]
Remember that they serve the[A][NL]
Guardian Spirit in the same way[NL]
you all serve your leaders.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]Ah, that is where the difference lies.[NL]
I man the wheel of my own ship.[A]
[Left]Yes...[.....] As do I.[A]
[FarRight]There are some exceptions. You are a[NL]
unique bunch, I'll give you that...[A][NL]
But we lack the time. Will you place[NL]
your trust in me, [Tact]?[A]
[Left]With all you've told? It's a lot to[NL]
take in. But yes. I trust you.[A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadArya]It's a lot for any Shizonian to learn[NL]
that we're essentially a[A][NL]
cult dedicated to old ways.[A]
[FarRight]You are not wrong. What about the[NL]
rest of you? Will you join me?[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Please. I wish to correct[NL]
the errors of my past.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]It will require some mulling over.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadKendrick]I said it before already, I man the[NL]
wheel of my own ship. I don't intend to[A][NL]
make any long-term commitments, but I have a[NL]
score to settle with Cesaria, and I[A][NL]
have a feeling you intend[NL]
to strike back.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]I'm with Kendrick on this one.[NL]
I'll aid you now.[A]
[FarRight]That is all I ask. Cesaria has[NL]
done me an injustice.[A]
[Left]What is it you need?[A]
[FarRight]We are going to go to the Cesarian[NL]
capital. I do not fault the emperor for[A][NL]
this desolation. No, the fault lies with the[NL]
military and General Rex. I do not wish[A][NL]
to promote full-scale war, but we are[NL]
Shizonians,[Smile] and we'll do what we do best.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]You want us to kill the[NL]
General of the Cesarian military?[A]
[ClearFace][LoadKendrick][Smile]Oh ho ho...[.....] This is gonna be more[NL]
fun than I ever thought.[A]
[Left]I wish to join your order. If this is what[NL]
you desire. [Smile]I will aid you, Xexim.[A]
[Right]As a Shizonian, I must follow with you.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]I am with [Tact].[NL]
I stand with Xexim.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc]You're not seriously doing[NL]
this, Kendrick. Are you?[A]
[ClearFace][LoadKendrick]They'll need a ship to get there.[NL]
And I have a score to settle with them[A][NL]
myself. [Smile]Of course I'm going along.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc][Smile]Then I suppose there's no real decision[NL]
for me. [Smile]Why did Cesaria attack, anyway?[A]
[FarRight]Long has Shizon held an agreement with[NL]
Cesaria. So long as we are not dragged[A][NL]
into their wars, we will not unite against[NL]
them. The assassins of Shizon are some[A][NL]
of the most skilled on the planet, and[NL]
united, we would be a threat to[A][NL]
any of the nations.[A]
[Left]So they wanted to break the agreement?[A]
[FarRight]No. When Rex arose to the position of[NL]
General just a few years ago, he made his[A][NL]
views on the Higher Beings public. He[NL]
believes them to be false, an excuse[A][NL]
for war and a cheap explanation of the[NL]
reason for the differing[A][NL]
energies of the world.[A]
[FarLeft]You mean Inge and Vene?[A]
[FarRight]Yes. Unfortunately, this slowly escalated[NL]
into a heavy disagreement between he[A][NL]
and I. I never imagined it would have[NL]
escalated this far... He has shattered[A][NL]
our old agreement. Marching on Cesaria is[NL]
our only option now. We must kill Rex,[A][NL]
so that a new man will take his place and[NL]
perhaps return to the truth.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Are you saying that we're[NL]
basically a cult going to go kill[A][NL]
a guy who doesn't believe in us?[A]
[FarRight]Indeed.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Is this truly the way of[NL]
the Higher Beings?[A]
[FarRight]It is what they desire. Not for[NL]
reverence, but simply acknowledgement[A][NL]
of their existence. How would you feel if a[NL]
race sometime in the future denied the[A][NL]
existence of humanity? You would call[NL]
them a fool. It is no different.[A]
[Left]Very well. Let us accompany you. I[NL]
appreciate the honesty, and I'm[A][NL]
sure my companions do as well.[A]
[FarRight]Of course. Now let us go for[NL]
the capital of Cesaria,[A][NL]
and give our regards to General Rex.[A][X]
