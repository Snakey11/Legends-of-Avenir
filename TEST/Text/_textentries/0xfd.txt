What have we here? You aren't Adlez.[A]
[Left][MoveRight][FarLeft][MoveLeft][Right]
No. [Smile]I'll take it as a compliment you[NL]
can see that. My name is [Tact].[A][NL]
I'm a freelancer from Haedric.[Smile][NL]
I came from the town of Danaan to put[A][NL]
an end to this bandit menace. Now[NL]
I've given you my name. What's yours?[A]
[FarRight]I am Uzkalis, Grand Magi of Thunder,[NL]
second in command of Xavus' new Arcanae.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadFinoc][Left]New Arcanae?[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke]
Xavus, the Dark Magi, and Uzkalis lead a[NL]
sort of revolution. They currently hold[A][NL]
much of the power in Arcanae. Mistlain of[NL]
Fire and Muriel of Wind resist them, but[A][NL]
lack the military foothold to do anything.[NL]
They mostly just support Cesaria.[A][NL]
Alexis, the Light Magi, is a[NL]
pacifist and remains neutral.[A]
[FarLeft]I never realized this war was[NL]
as much a civil war in Arcanae[A][NL]
as it was international...[A]
[Right]Quiet, you two.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadUzkalis]
The real question I have... What do two[NL]
Haedrician warriors and a monk have to[A][NL]
do with soldiers bearing the crest[NL]
of Altia? Did your Anguis[A][NL]
finally rescind his neutrality?[A]
[FarLeft]We were here to deal with the bandits.[NL]
We encountered these warriors and[A][NL]
temporarily aligned ourselves with them to[NL]
meet out mutual goal. Nothing more.[A]
[FarRight]Interesting... Nevertheless. You must have[NL]
the artifact that Adlez had. Give[A][NL]
it to me, and I'll pay the same[NL]
price he had offered.[A][X]
