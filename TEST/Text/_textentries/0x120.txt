This is it. Today, we decide[NL]
the fate of this war.[A]
[Left]Indeed. I have faith.[A]
[FarLeft]I've come this far. This is for Danaan,[NL]
for Gerwick, and for all the misguided souls.[A]
[FarRight]I'm ready. I will finish this,[NL]
and find my purpose. The truth.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadElanil]
Arcanians, Haedricians, and Altians... A[NL]
funny combination. [Smile]Nobody else I'd rather[A][NL]
fight alongside exists, though.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadFinoc]
I trust you, [Tact]. We can do this. If[NL]
not, it's been one hell of a ride.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][Smile][LoadHelmer]
This is the time to make amends for what[NL]
was done to the Puma Brigade...[A][NL]
General Leyos... I'm coming.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadVal]
Mom... Dad... This is finally it.[NL]
I will avenge you both. Today.[A]
[Right]Let's go, everyone.[A][X]
