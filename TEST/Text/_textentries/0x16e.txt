I'm surprised by how many people are[NL]
just out and about... Why do we[A][NL]
cooperate with these fools?[A]
[FarLeft]Connor...[.......] shut it.[A]
[Left]Sorry, boss.[A]
[Right]This city is nothing like the[NL]
capitals of Arcanae or Cesaria.[A]
[FarRight]Haedric has a long history of separation[NL]
in terms of populations. Yerchek was[A][NL]
considered small amongst the towns in[NL]
Haedric. Danaan was little more than a[A][NL]
village. This city, Urbsis, is just one of[NL]
the larger cities. The Basileus resides[A][NL]
here, of course, so it has the most[NL]
foreigners visiting, but not in[A][NL]
times such as these.[A]
[Right]That makes sense. Where do[NL]
we go from here, Adlez?[A]
[FarLeft]Just to Basileus Leon's castle.[A][Left][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
Walking right into our[NL]
potential enemy's turf?[A]
[FarRight]Stay on guard, Baret.[NL]
You're good at that.[A]
[Left]Understood.[A][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadSoldier]
You are Adlez and his retainers, no?[A]
[FarLeft]That's correct. I'm Adlez. This[NL]
is my right hand man, [Tact].[A]
[Left][LoadConnor]Wait a minute...[A][Right][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Shut up, Connor.[A]
[FarRight]Follow me. This way.[A][X]
