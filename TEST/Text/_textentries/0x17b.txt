Hawken... Damn you-![A]
[Right]Stand down! The city is[NL]
under our control![A]
[Left]Your control!? Bacrun is[NL]
under nobody's control![A]
[FarRight]Connor, take[FarLeft][LoadConnor][FarRight] him to the council chamber[NL]
with the rest of the guildsmen and lock[A][NL]
them. We're not here to kill them, but we[NL]
don't want them in our way when Cesaria[A][NL]
and Arcanae come knocking...[A]
[FarLeft]I'm on it.[A][Left][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadBaret][Left][LoadVicar][FarLeft]
Adlez, with the building secured and Hawken[NL]
dead, most of the mercenaries are[A][NL]
fleeing. Shall we go after them?[A]
[FarRight]Don't bother, I need you all here[NL]
right now. Vicar, what's the[A][NL]
status on Leon and his men?[A]
[Left]I just sent Walter to go to the main[NL]
western gate. He should be back soon.[A]
[FarRight]Good. We need to regroup quickly,[NL]
I'm sure word will reach Cesaria[A][NL]
and Arcanae before long.[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][Right][MoveMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
What's our strategy to defend from[NL]
them when they arrive?[A][CloseSpeech]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]We can use the city to our advantage. The[NL]
alleyways will allow us to fight them[A][NL]
in small numbers more easily...[A]
[MidLeft]What about the artifact? We can[NL]
use that to our advantage, can't we?[A]
[MidRight]Of course. I certainly intend to be making[NL]
use of the Vathrylian guardians as we[NL]
fight. They are strong, yet expendable.[A]
[MidLeft]We just have to be careful.[A]
[MidRight]To be honest, [Tact]-[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadWalter]
Leon's men have broken though. Most of[NL]
the mercenaries fled when they heard of[A][NL]
Hawken's death. Leon himself is[NL]
en route here now.[A]
[Left]Adlez?[A]
[MidRight]I'll tell you later. Let's go meet[NL]
with Leon. We have planning to do.[A][X]
