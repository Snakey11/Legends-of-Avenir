[MidRight][LoadEfil][MidLeft][LoadXavus]
What have we here? Efil? What brings you[NL]
crawling from that temple in Draterus?[A]
[MidRight]This war needs to stop, Xavus.[A]
[MidLeft]What, and you're gonna stop it?[NL]
It's not just us fighting, you[A][NL]
know. War is never one-sided.[A]
[MidRight]Maximus said something similar. Withdraw,[NL]
Xavus. If you withdraw, Maximus swears not[A][NL]
to follow. Then peace can be negotiated.[A]
[MidLeft]Ha! And for what? Cesaria[NL]
never listened to us before.[A]
[MidRight]I'll act as a mediator. I know you, and[NL]
I know them. We can reach a compromise.[A]
[MidLeft]And if not?[A]
[MidRight]I'll end the war another way. But I'd[NL]
rather let it end peacefully. It's[A][NL]
destroying Avenir, Xavus. People are[NL]
dying. It's the same thing I fought[A][NL]
for ten years ago, only now[NL]
it's self-destruction.[A]
[MidLeft][TMM]...[.......] [TMM]I am sorry, Efil. I can't. Too many men[NL]
have died, both by your hand today and[A][NL]
by the Cesarians. There is no other way.[A]
[MidRight][LoadEfil]Xavus! No! You can[NL]
still stop this![A]
[MidLeft]No. I can't.[A][X]
