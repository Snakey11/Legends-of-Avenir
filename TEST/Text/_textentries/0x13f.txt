[FarRight][LoadMaximus][FarLeft][LoadFinoc]Captain Maximus![A]
[FarRight]You! The Altian! Lux notified me you[NL]
had joined their team. Finoc, was it?[A]
[FarLeft]Yes. I think they're following me.[A]
[FarRight]They'd better be. We're in a tough position[NL]
here. Many of my men are wounded.[A]
[FarLeft]Order them to hold this position. Lux and[NL]
[Tact] should be arriving with the[A][NL]
others soon. We're both capable, we should[NL]
be able to hold out at least for a bit.[A]
[FarRight]Thank you, Finoc. Capable soldiers, to me![NL]
We'll have to hold off until we can meet[A][NL]
up with Vice-Captain Lux and [Tact]![A][X]
