We must be getting close at this point...[A]
[MidLeft]There's a bridge near here. It was[NL]
assembled a few years ago to defend[A][NL]
against the Wanderers in Draterus.[NL]
It's controlled by Bacrun now.[A]
[Right]Who governs Bacrun, anyway?[A]
[MidLeft]The Council of Guildsmen. It's a group[NL]
of people that run the largest[A][NL]
merchant guilds in Avenir.[A]
[FarRight]Doesn't sound like they have much[NL]
of a way to defend themself.[A]
[MidLeft]There's a mercenary group there, employed by[NL]
the Council, but they're unlikely to[A][NL]
interfere in this. No, we have to catch[NL]
up to Uzkalis before he reaches[A][NL]
Bacrun. I sent Jasper ahead to scout.[A]
[FarRight]Looks like he's coming back now.[NL]
I'll leave this to you all.[A][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]Private Jasper,[FarRight][LoadJasper][MidLeft] what do[NL]
you have to report?[A]
[FarRight]They've moved past the bridge, but[NL]
they seem to have stopped there.[A][NL]
I saw no sign of Uzkalis himself.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadLux]What!?[A]
[Right]Were we lured off?[A]
[FarRight]I couldn't tell you.[A]
[MidLeft]Very well. Thank you for the information,[NL]
Private. You're dismissed.[A]
[FarRight]Thank you sir.[A][ClearFace][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadElanil]
[Tact], we have a problem. Finoc and I[NL]
were watching our back, and on one[A][NL]
of his quick flank checks, he saw[NL]
Uzkalis and some of his men.[A]
[Left][LoadLux]Dammit! He plans on flanking us![NL]
We have to push forward and get[A][NL]
rid of the group across the bridge.[A][X]
