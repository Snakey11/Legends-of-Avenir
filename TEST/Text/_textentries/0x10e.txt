It's very different from the Basileus' Castle[NL]
in Haedric. Larger. More... elegant.[A]
[FarLeft]The Council Building in Arcanae is similar[NL]
to this. What about in Altia, Elanil?[A]
[Left]We prefer humbleness. The Anguis lives in a[NL]
larger house, but the actual commodities[A][NL]
are about the same as any other citizen.[NL]
Same with the High Priest, only[A][NL]
his quarters accompany the church.[A]
[Right]The difference in cultures across Avenir...[NL]
That's really what brought us all here.[A][NL]
This is where it ends, though. We get inside,[NL]
and we kill the Emperor. Cesaria is[A][NL]
plunged into chaos and demoralized,[NL]
Xavus and Uzkalis win the war,[A][NL]
and we go back to our lives.[A]
[FarRight]Who's to say we can get out?[NL]
We'll be surrounded.[A]
[FarLeft]The Cesarian palace is the pinnacle of[NL]
engineering and architecture today. I[A][NL]
imagine we can slip into one of the many[NL]
passages, and with their guard force[A][NL]
spread so thin, hopefully, we[NL]
can force our way out.[A]
[Left]I can live with that.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Cesaria will need help afterwards.[NL]
I'd like to help with reconstruction.[A]
[Right]Talk to Uzkalis about it.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadVal]I can speak to him on[NL]
your behalf, Luke.[A]
[FarLeft]Don't worry about it.[NL]
I can do it. Let's go.[A][X]
