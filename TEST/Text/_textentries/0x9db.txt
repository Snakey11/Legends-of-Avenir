Stop right there, Uzkalis![A]
[FarLeft]Well, well, well. If it isn't Captain[NL]

I had an idea you might try to[NL]
sacrifice your men to make[A][NL]
an escape. But it won't work![A]
[FarRight]Oh, if only you were right.[NL]
[Smile]I'll just dispose of you all[A][NL]
and then make my escape then![A]
[MidLeft][Smile]I wish you luck with that![A][X]
