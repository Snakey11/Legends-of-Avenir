I just received word that Cesaria and Arcanae[NL]
have mobilized. Unfortunately, they have[A][NL]
enacted a temporary truce until Bacrun is[NL]
under the Council of Guildsmen's control.[A]
[FarLeft]So we're on our own...[A]
[FarRight]We still have the artifact. It will help[NL]
turn the tide. But we need to have a plan.[A][NL]
The main Haedrician force took heavy losses[NL]
while distracting the mercenaries.[A]
[FarLeft]Most of my men are still around.[NL]
but they aren't much help[A][NL]
aganst an organized military.[A]
[FarRight]Correct. Under most circumstances, I'd[NL]
say we must defend on the outer edge[A][NL]
of Bacrun, but we would spread our[NL]
forces too thinly. We need to[A][NL]
fight them on the streets,[NL]
in a more individual context.[A]
[Left]That makes sense to me. Haedricians[NL]
aren't used to fighting in an[A][NL]
organized manner, anyway. It[NL]
certainly gives us an edge[A][NL]
over Cesaria and Arcanae. By[NL]
the way, have we tested the[A][NL]
limitations of the artifact yet?[A]
[FarLeft]We have not tested it, per se...[A]
[FarRight]Most artifacts of this type do have their[NL]
limitations. I would guess we only have a[A][NL]
few battalions of Vathrylians at our[NL]
disposal until the artifact loses its[A][NL]
energy and needs to recharge.[A]
[Right]So we have to rely on our own[NL]
skills and judgment. Against the[A][NL]
two biggest armies in Avenir.[A]
[FarRight]I trust you al. I believe we have a[NL]
chance. Now let's head out.[A][NL]
We have a hard fight ahead of us.[A][X]
