This trudge to Draterus is harder[NL]
work than I would have expected...[A]
[Left]I agree. Adlez, we won't be able to[NL]
make it like this. We aren't prepared[A][NL]
to trudge straight into a desert.[A]
[Right]What do you propose we do?[A]
[FarLeft]We can change our route to head[NL]
to Bacrun and restock there.[A]
[Right]The city of merchants? It's a possibility. I'd[NL]
like to avoid run-ins with the Council of[A][NL]
Guildsmen while we're there, though.[A]
[FarLeft]Why's that?[A]
[Right]They keep a pretty accurate record of bandits[NL]
and criminals throughout Avenir. The city[A][NL]
is full of bounty hunters, and the council[NL]
likes to hold... games, if you will, to[A][NL]
see who can capture the criminals.[A]
[FarLeft]I understand. We'll try to lay low while there.[NL]
We just need to get supplies so that[A][NL]
we can adequately survive in the desert.[A]
[FarRight]Arya, aren't you worried[NL]
going into Bacrun?[A]
[FarLeft]Not really. Yes, I may technically have a[NL]
bounty on my head for...[.....] things I have done,[A][NL]
but if they capture me...[......] let's just say bad[NL]
things would happen to my captors. The[A][NL]
council and the bounty hunters know this.[NL][Smile]
Things...[....] work out that way for Shizonians.[A]
[Right]I'll leave the talking[NL]
up to you all, then.[A]
[FarRight]Understandable. To Bacrun we go,[NL]
then. Hopefully the Haedricians[A][NL]
aren't after us...[A][X]
