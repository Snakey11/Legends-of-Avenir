Hey, Arc.[A]
[MidLeft][Tact]... *sigh* I'm such a fool.[A]
[MidRight]Arc, you can't cling to what happened[NL]
to Danaan. It's not any of our faults[A][NL]
individually. Blame Gerwick[NL]
for being a fool.[A]
[MidLeft]It was my choice to leave.[NL]
I should have stayed. We[A][NL]
should have divided[NL]
and conquered.[A]
[MidRight]And then what? All three of us would be[NL]
dead and Danaan would still be destroyed.[A]
[MidLeft]I'd rather have died doing my[NL]
duty than live knowing I failed.[A]
[MidRight]I'd rather honor their memory[NL]
by doing what I know is right.[A][CloseSpeech][.......]
[MidLeft][Tact]...[.....][A]
[MidRight]Arc. It's your choice what[NL]
to do with your life.[A]
[MidLeft]I'm coming with you. Perhaps I'll[NL]
find a new purpose in our journey.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Thank you, Arc. I appreciate it.[NL]
It brings me great comfort having[A][NL]
someone I can thoroughly rely on.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]You can rely on me so long as I[NL]
believe this is a path to follow.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadLuke]
Arc! [Tact]! Lux is calling[NL]
us! We're heading out.[A]
[MidRight]We're on our way![A][X]
