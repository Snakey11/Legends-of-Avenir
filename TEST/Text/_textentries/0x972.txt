[FarLeft][LoadArya]Their commander is coming.[FarRight][LoadPlayer][FarLeft] I took care[NL]
of the rest of them, but we have[A][NL]
to fend off this last group.[A]
[FarRight][MoveRight]Stop. Who is Xexim? There's more[NL]
than just the leader of Shizon to him.[A][NL]
I've heard too many references to a better[NL]
understanding of the higher beings,[A][NL]
and not just anyone can control the[NL]
Vathrylian guardians we fought [A][NL]
in the trial.[A]
[FarRight][LoadArc][FarLeft]He can explain himself after this battle,[NL]
but it won't do you any favors to[A][NL]
have the Cesarians get to him.[A]
[FarRight]Lay off her, [Tact].[NL]
She's right.[A]
[Right]Dammit... Very well.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][CloseSpeech]
[Pause]
[FarLeft][LoadJurgen]So this is the small band that's[NL]
destroyed my brigade. Of course I[A][NL]
have to handle things myself.[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]Captain Jurgen of the[NL]
Cesarian Lion Brigade...[A]
[Left][LoadLuke]Kendrick? Do you know him?[A]
[FarRight]He used to serve as the Lieutenant and[NL]
Vice-Captain under the current General,[A][NL]
Rex. He's very levelheaded and skilled. He[NL]
often led their navy against[A][NL]
me during my... ah... Old days.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadArc][Left]So he'll be a bit of a challenge.[A]
[FarLeft]I doubt he'll try to[NL]
face us all by himself.[A]
[FarRight]You'd be right, there. He's always[NL]
been a cautious fighter. I bet if we[A][NL]
destroy enough of his troops, he'll retreat.[NL]
We won't be able to all gang up on[A][NL]
him, though. He'll keep his elite[NL]
soldiers by his side.[A]
[Right]It's fine. I've not met a group I feel[NL]
more comfortable fighting alongside[A][NL]
than you all. Let's do this.[A][X]
