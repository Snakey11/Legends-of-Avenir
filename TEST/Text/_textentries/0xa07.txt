[MidLeft][LoadVillagerMan2][FarRight][LoadTyrone][Right][LoadMayor]
Thank you for the information. Start[NL]
making your way to the capital. I[A][NL]
have feeling that those bandits[A][NL]
will be coming here next...[A]
[MidLeft]I understand. Thank you.[A][ClearFace][....][Right][MoveMidLeft]
Tyrone, what do you think of this?[A][CloseSpeech][FarRight][MoveMidRight]
These are ill tidings... I have no[NL]
doubt the bandits are lead by Adlez.[A][MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadMayor]
Adlez? Wasn't he one of your[NL]
warriors ten years ago?[A]
[MidRight]Yes. Unfortunately, he and I had[NL]
different morals and thoughts about the[A][NL]
conflict between Cesaria and Arcanae, hence[NL]
why he left to form his bandit clan...[A]
[MidLeft]He sounds like a rat.[A]
[MidRight]He's a good man. It's disappointing to see[NL]
him fall so low... I will stay here and[A][NL]
defend the artifact with my life.[A]
[MidLeft]We should have sent it to the capital.[A]
[MidRight]I trust my ability to defend more than I trust[NL]
Basileus Leon's restraint in using it.[A]
[MidLeft]I see. As a Haedrician warrior,[NL]
I am yours to command, Warlord.[A]
[MidRight]Defend your people. Should you fall, I[NL]
fear that they will take the artifact[A][NL]
and use it how they see fit...[A]
[MidLeft]I understand. I shall see you[NL]
after this battle, Tyrone.[A]
[MidRight]Indeed. Good luck.[A][X]
