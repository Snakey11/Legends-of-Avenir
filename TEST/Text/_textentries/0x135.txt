[MidLeft][LoadUzkalis][.....][MidRight][LoadMage]
Lord Uzkalis, we have a problem. It seems[NL]
the Altian Wyvern Rider took notice of[A][NL]
us on his reconnaissance flight. The[NL]
enemy has sped their movements.[A]
[MidLeft]It is no matter. The esteemed Captain[NL]
Maximus is far away in Cesaria at[A][NL]
this point. We have nothing to worry[NL]
about. Their Vice-Captain, Lux is[A][NL]
nothing, and [Tact] is a fool for[NL]
not siding with Arcanae. What[A][NL]
are their movements now?[A]
[MidRight]They seem to have sped their movements[NL]
towards the bridge. They must want to[A][NL]
intercept the group headed towards Bacrun.[A]
[MidLeft]Very well. Let them. We shall try to maintain[NL]
our distance. Should the other group fall,[A][NL]
we use their sacrifice to make our escape.[A]
[MidRight]Yes, my lord.[A][X]
