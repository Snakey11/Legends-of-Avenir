[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadWalter]
Hey, [Tact].[A]
[MidLeft]Walter, are you guys sticking with us?[A]
[MidRight]Looks that way. I don't quite know[NL]
Vicar's reasoning to be honest...[A]
[MidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[MidRight]He's always wanted to escape from all this.[NL]
To see him diving in at the forefront of a[A][NL]
movement that will only prolong the war...[NL]
It's odd. But I trust him, as does Baret.[A]
[MidLeft]You're all very close, aren't you?[A]
[MidRight]Yeah. Baret and I were left on our[NL]
own when we were younger and Vicar[A][NL]
took us in. Taught us how to fight. Soon[NL]
enough, we were a small mercenary group[A][NL]
taking odd jobs here and there. Never[NL]
thought we'd end up as bandits though.[A]
[MidLeft]I feel you. Who can argue, though? It's good[NL]
pay, a fairly stable line of work if[A][NL]
you're smart about it, not to mention[NL]
we've got this whole plot brewing.[A]
[MidRight]Vicar puts faith in you, [Tact]. My[NL]
brother is willing to roll with whatever,[A][NL]
so long as he gets to fight. I just[NL]
hope we're on the right path.[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadAdlez]
We received word from the Basileus.[NL]
He wants us to set out for the[A][NL]
capital to meet with us immediately.[A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveFarRight][Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Don't you fear a trap?[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Of course I do. If it were anyone but[NL]
Leon, I'd have more suspicions.[A]
[Right]So what do you plan to do?[A]
[MidLeft]Just a few of us are gonna go. A large[NL]
brunt of the clan will stay back here. If[A][NL]
they don't receive word from us within a[NL]
day of us leaving, they are to scatter.[A]
[FarRight]You're not going to[NL]
leave us behind, are you?[A]
[MidLeft]I have one of my men overseeing things.[NL]
Walter, go talk to Vicar and Baret. I[A][NL]
want both of them to come with us.[A]
[FarRight]Of course. I'm on it.[A][ClearFace][Right]
Who else do you intend to bring?[A]
[MidLeft]Me, you, Arya, Connor. I don't trust[NL]
leaving Connor here in command. Arya[A][NL]
wants to see how this plays out. And I trust[NL]
you. I want a group of people I[A][NL]
trust to think for themselves.[A]
[Right]Adlez, are you sure about this?[A]
[MidLeft]If it is a trap, we'll cut our way[NL]
through them. I'm sure Connor[A][NL]
[Smile]would be satisfied with that.[A]
[Right][Smile]Ha! I'm sure. He certainly seems[NL]
like a real piece of work...[A]
[MidLeft]He is, but he [Smile]appeals to the rest of[NL]
the clan. I'll go fetch them, you finish[A][NL]
whatever preparations you need to make.[NL]
I'm relying on you, [Tact].[A]
[Right]I won't let you down.[A][X]
