[FarLeft][LoadVicar][Left][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadWalter][Right][LoadEfil]
This is... tragic.[A]
[Left]Efil, there was no other way.[NL]
Sometimes, there's nothing you can do.[A]
[FarLeft]More men will be on their way. It's[NL]
best if we split and head our[A][NL]
separate ways. Baret, Walter, let's go.[A][ClearFace][LoadBaret]
[FarRight]Yes Vicar. I'm sorry, Efil.[A][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]I'd rather run now than be[NL]
hunted to my death. Let's go.[A][ClearFace]
[Right]Godspeed,[FarRight][LoadAdlez][Right] friends...[A]
[FarRight]Arya, you can go.[A][FarLeft][LoadArya]
Adlez...[A]
[FarRight]I failed. Here's your pay. Thank you for[NL]
everything. I'll be returning to Haedric.[A]
[FarLeft][TMM]...[.....] [TMM]Yes, Adlez. You're[NL]
welcome. Goodbye, all.[A][ClearFace]
[Right]Adlez, I'm sorry...[A]
[FarRight]It's not your fault. I was a fool. I didn't[NL]
realize how deep the hatred was... Now I must[A][NL]
pay the price for my crimes. I've decided to[NL]
turn myself in. I may hang, but at least[A][NL]
I will die with a clearer conscience.[A]
[Left]Adlez...[A]
[FarRight][Tact], thank you for being a good[NL]
friend and companion through this, but don't[NL]
follow me. Make a new life for yourself.[A][ClearFace]
[Left]Adlez...[.....] I will. Thank you.[A]
[Right]I will be returning to Draterus. I was[NL]
right that I shouldn't leave that temple.[A]
[Left]I'm so sorry, Efil.[A]
[Right]Do not blame yourself. Some things are[NL]
destined to succeed, while others are[A][NL]
doomed to fail. I was a hero once.[NL]
Today, I am not. Goodbye, friend.[A]
[Left]Goodbye. Wait, where did Kendrick go?[A]
[Right]Looks like he bailed on us. I could tell[NL]
he was slimy, but go before they arrive![A][X]
