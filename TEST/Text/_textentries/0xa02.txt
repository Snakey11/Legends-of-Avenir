That's that. Grab the[NL]
loot, and start booking[A][NL]
it back to the hideout.[A]
[FarLeft][Tact], whose caravan is this?[A]
[FarRight]What do you mean?[A]
[FarLeft]Well, we only saw the guards. There[NL]
must be merchants or officials who[A][NL]
were in charge of the actual goods.[A]
[FarRight]You're right... They must have fled, likely[NL]
with a good portion of the loot.[A]
[Right]Does it really matter? We[NL]
did our job, didn't we?[A]
[FarRight]Let's grab what we can scavenge from the[NL]
caravan, but I'd guess most of the true[A][NL]
valuables were taken away.[NL]
What's the nearest town?[A]
[Left]Yercheck. It's a village in Haedric, somewhat[NL]
similar to Danaan. I believe Warlord[A][NL]
Tyrone resides near there, so we'd be[NL]
fighting warriors a step above even what[A][NL]
we fought today. We definitely would want[NL]
to return to Adlez before attacking.[A]
[FarRight]That makes our move clear, then.[A]
[Left]I'll grab some of the loot.[NL]
Walter, help out.[A]
[FarLeft]Yes, brother.[A][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
[FarRight]Arya, I take it your job here is finished?[A]
[Right]I'm still confused as to why I[NL]
was even hired in the first place.[A]
[Left]I don't pretend to[NL]
understand Adlez' motives.[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight]I don't think it was his idea. From talking[NL]
to him and Connor, their ambitions seem to[A][NL]
be mostly Connor's. That man is far more[NL]
concerning to me than Adlez...[A]
[Right]I want to understand what's going on[NL]
here. My first loyalty is to my contract,[A][NL]
but Shizon also tries to keep tabs on the[NL]
happenings of Avenir. If there's a larger[A][NL]
game afoot here, I need to know.[A]
[FarRight]You're a good fighter. I definitely[NL]
appreciate the addition to the[A][NL]
team. Shall we go, Vicar?[A][CloseSpeech]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]All seems to be in order. Walter and[NL]
Baret seem to have grabbed what they[A][NL]
can... Yes. We need to have a[NL]
nice chat with Adlez and Connor.[A][X]
