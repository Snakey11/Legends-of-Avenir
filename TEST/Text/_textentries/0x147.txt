Hey, you all![A]
[Left]You! What do you want?[A]
[FarRight]I overheard you saying you're[NL]
attacking Danaan. I want in.[A][CloseSpeech]
[Left][MoveRight]What reason do we[NL]
have to trust you?[A]
[Pause]
[FarRight]Your buddies attacked me back there.[A][Left][LoadBaret]
[FarLeft]He has a point there, Vicar. We might as[NL]
well bring him along. Maybe[A][NL]
Adlez will have some use for him.[A]
[Right]Perhaps... What do you think, Baret?[A]
[Left]We've been just us for ages. I see no[NL]
reason to add another member to our group.[A]
[Right]Lighten up, brother. He's pretty skilled,[NL]
and Danaan's militia are no pushovers.[A]
[FarLeft]I'll make the call. What's your name?[A]
[FarRight]I'm [Tact].[A]
[Right]My name's Vicar. I'm a former Haedric[NL]
warrior, but now I'm just a[A][NL]
travelling mercenary with these two.[A]
[FarLeft]I'm Walter. It's a[NL]
pleasure to meet you.[A]
[Left]The name's Baret. Stay out of my[NL]
way and I'll stay out of yours.[A]
[Right]Welcome to the team, [Tact]. Let's get[NL]
heading. Adlez' bandit clan is[A][NL]
organizing the attack on Danaan, so[NL]
we're heading to meet up with them.[A]
[FarRight]I gotcha.[A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][Right][.....][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
Keep an eye on [Tact], Baret.[A]
[Left]Of course. Should we tell Walter?[A]
[Right]No need. I trust your judgment.[A]
[Left]I appreciate it.[A][X]
