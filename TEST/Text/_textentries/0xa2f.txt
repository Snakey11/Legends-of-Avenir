Why do you approach me? You should[NL]
know the futility of your efforts.[A]
[MidLeft]I know the futility of this entire[NL]
battle. I knew it going into this.[A]
[MidRight]Why did you seek to capture Bacrun then?[NL]
Your motivations... They seem irrational.[A]
[MidLeft]This war, between you and Cesaria... What's[NL]
the point? What do you seek? Power?[A][NL]
Forcing your power upon others is only[NL]

[MidRight]You did this... To make a point?[A]
[MidLeft]Of course. Whether you take it or not is[NL]
up to you, I have nothing else to say.[A]
[MidRight]You've fought honorably. Unfortunately, I[NL]
cannot spare you. I do not know your name,[A][NL]
but I will speak highly of you after[NL]
this battle. Goodbye, Haedrician.[A][X]
