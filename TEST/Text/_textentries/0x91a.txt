[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]Vathryl was...[.......] unique to put it mildly.[.....][NL]
It was named for it's inhabitants,[A][NL]
the Vathrylians,[.] who developed as elves[NL]
and humans coexisted and had offspring.[A][NL]
The Vathrylians had a unique aptitude[NL]
for magic and created their own[A][NL]
empire that dominated the others.[.....][NL]
At the time,[.] Haedric was an elven[A][NL]
nation, Arcanae was much smaller,[NL]
Cesaria didn't exist,[....] and[A][NL]
Altia was the land of the humans.[NL]
However,[.] Vathrylians were driven[A][NL]
by greed for knowledge.[....] At one point,[NL]
the Grand Master of Vathryl along with[A][NL]
the Five Commanders attempted to combine the[NL]
two energies of the world,[.] Inge[A][NL]
and Vene,[.] to create true immortality[NL]
for themselves. [....]They discovered,[.] however,[A][NL]
that it had awful effects on the land.[NL]
As the empire was struck by blight and[A][NL]
drought,[.] it slowly transformed into the[NL]
desert it was now.[.....] The Vathrylians[A][NL]
died out. Many of their creations still[NL]
stand underneath the sands of Draterus,[A][NL]
but the beings they created guard these ruins.[NL]
Many people wish to uncover the artifacts[A][NL]
and secrets of Vathryl,[.] but lack the courage[NL]
to journey there themselves.[......] It is a[A][NL]
touchy subject for spirits such as I.[......][A][X]
