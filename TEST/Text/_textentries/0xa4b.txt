[FarLeft][LoadAdlez][MidRight][LoadVicar][Left][LoadPlayer]
So, today is the day...[A]
[MidRight]Indeed. It feels like quite a long[NL]
time ago when[Smile] we first encountered[A][NL]
you and you asked to join us.[A]
[Left][Smile]Ha! You didn't trust me at first.[A]
[MidRight]Of course not. I had Baret[NL]
keeping an eye on you, but you[A][NL]
were honest from the get-go.[A]
[Left]I never really was fit[Smile] to be a bandit...[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Neither was I. That's[NL]
why we're here, is it not?[A]
[Left]Yeah. Where are the others, anyway?[A]
[MidRight]Walter and Baret are still asleep. This[NL]
has been quite the change for them...[A][NL]
It's only fair to give them their rest.[A]
[FarLeft]Arya, Kendrick, and Efil are scouting[NL]
ahead. They should be back soon.[A]
[MidRight]I can see them coming now.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight]
[Left]What's the word?[FarRight][LoadArya][Left][A]
[FarRight]Looks like two fairly strong forces are[NL]
moving towards each other. The Cesarian[A][NL]
group bore the flag of a tiger, so it[NL]
must be Captain Maximus. The Arcanian[A][NL]
force looked to be led by Xavus,[NL]
the Grand Magi of Darkness.[A]
[Left]So two of the key leaders on each side...[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadEfil]
I know Maximus. He was one of the first[NL]
people I met on my journey. He[A][NL]
will listen to us... I know he will.[A]
[Left]And Xavus?[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]
I've done business with him a few times.[A]
[FarLeft]What sort of business?[A]
[FarRight]Artifacts. Weapons. The sort. War is[NL]
profitable for us businessmen, you know.[A]
[FarLeft]If you say so.[A]
[Left]So, what's the plan?[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadEfil]
We ride out right between them.[NL]
We pray they listen to us.[A]
[FarLeft]What if they don't listen?[A]
[FarRight]We fight. There is no other option. I[NL]
don't want to raise my sword against[A][NL]
Maximus, but if it comes to[NL]
it, I won't hesitate.[A]
[Left]What does the battlefield look like?[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArya]
There is a small fortress on the Arcanae[NL]
side. Xavus will likely use it as a[A][NL]
strike base. Cesaria is moving from[NL]
the north and south. We'll likely[A][NL]
be caught in the middle.[A]
[Left]That doesn't bode well...[A]
[FarRight]That's only if it comes to[NL]
fighting. We'd best head out.[A]
[Right]I'll wake Walter and Baret.[A][X]
