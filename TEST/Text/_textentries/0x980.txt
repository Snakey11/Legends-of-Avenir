[MidRight][LoadXexim][FarFarLeft]There they are![A]
[MidLeft][LoadRex]Good work, men. [Smile]Well, well, well.[NL]
What have we here? Xexim of the Four[A][NL]
Orden, leader of Shizon. I must have[NL]
a bounty on my head indeed.[A]
[MidRight]You know what you did, General. You sent[NL]
Jurgen to Shizon and attempted to[A][NL]
desecrate the temple to the Higher Beings.[A]
[MidLeft]Ha! So this isn't an attempt enlisted[NL]
by Arcanae? It's a personal grudge?[A][NL]
This changes things.[....] This may be fun...[.....][NL]
I believe that goes against[A][NL]
your culture, Xexim.[A]
[MidRight]There are exceptions to those who[NL]
defy the Higher Beings.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadRex]Hmph. If you say so.[A][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadPlayer]
He's not alone, you know.[A]
[MidLeft]Oh, you brought friends. A lone[NL]
mercenary, a monk, a militia leader, one[A][NL]
of your followers, and a pirate-[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]
Businessman.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]...[......] Businessman. I've heard all[NL]
about you. Such valiant defenders. It[A][NL]
matters not. My men will make[NL]
short work of you.[A]
[Right]Damn you, Rex.[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][Smile][.....][ClearFace][.......][FarLeft][LoadArya][Left][LoadPlayer]
Xexim, we're gonna have to fight through.[A]
[FarLeft]He's right. If we retreat,[NL]
it'll mean the end of Shizon.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]We'll stand by you. If we[NL]
fall here, so be it.[A]
[FarLeft]If this is the will of the Higher[NL]
Beings, then they are right.[A]
[Right][Smile]I had no intention of[NL]
retreating. Let's go![A][X]
