[FarRight][LoadKendrick][Smile]My oh my,[.] if it isn't Arya![A]
[FarLeft][LoadArya]Kendrick![A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight][Smile]There you are.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left][LoadArc]Who's this ruffian?[A]
[FarRight]The name's Kendrick. I'm a businessman, and[NL]
also a skilled skipper. I have a special[A][NL]
deal that lets me work with Shizon without[NL]
going through Cesarian politics.[A]
[FarLeft]That sounds...[.....] awfully handy.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]Do you not trust me, monk?[A]
[FarLeft]No, I do.[A][ClearFace]
[LoadPlayer]Calm down, Luke. What's[NL]
the deal, Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight]No deal. It's part of my business deal[NL]
with Xexim, Lord of Shizon, to escort[A][NL]
any Shizonians to and from the island.[NL]
You're all friends of Arya here,[A][Smile][NL]
so I'm sure it'll work out.[A]
[Left]Isn't Shizon strict about visitors?[A]
[Right]I'll take any blame for[NL]
that, don't worry.[A]
[FarRight]Anyway we've got everyone so[NL]
we may as well get going.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke]What's the hurry?[A]
[FarRight][Smile]This isn't a place you want to stick around[NL]
for long in, monk.[.] Port Selsing is[A][NL]
the wart of Arcanae.[.] I'm surprised[NL]
they still let it exist.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]I'm game. Arc?[A]
[Left]I suppose there was nothing left for[NL]
me in Danaan. I'll go with you all.[A]
[FarRight]Perfect. Let's go.[A]
[Left]Wait. Let's stock up on some[NL]
weapons while we're here.[A][X]
