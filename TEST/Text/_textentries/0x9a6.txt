[MidRight][LoadPlayer][MidLeft][LoadArc]
Ah, [Tact], you're up.[NL]
[Smile]Good morning.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Mornin' Arc. What's the word?[A]
[MidLeft]We're moving out soon. We received word back[NL]
from the Anguis that we [Smile]are free to[A][NL]
attack Cesaria from the border with Altia.[NL]
He's given us the location of an obscure[A][NL]
mountain pass he want's us to advance[NL]
through. The main force will take[A][NL]
the major highways. He'll provide some[NL]
troops for us, but not many.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Not surprising.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]The messenger did want[NL]
to see you, though.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveFarLeft]
[Left][LoadFinoc]Good to see you [Tact].[NL][MidRight][Smile][Left]
Looks like I've been assigned to[A][NL]
assist the Arcanian forces.[A]
[MidRight]So we'll be working together again.[NL]
Can't say I have problems with that.[A][NL]
Is Elanil here too?[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadElanil]Of course.[A]
[MidRight]So the whole team is back together.[NL]
That definitely makes me more comfortable.[A][NL]
Have either of you been to war before?[A]
[Left]Altia hasn't been in a full-scale war for[NL]
generations. This is new to all of us.[A]
[MidRight][MoveRight]What about you,[FarRight][LoadArc][Right] Arc?[A]
[FarRight]I'm a militia leader, not a soldier. Even[NL]
if I was, we all have independence in Haedric.[A]
[Right]So this will be an adventure. Let's[NL]
meet with Uzkalis. Arc, fetch Luke.[A]
[FarRight]Aye. Will do.[A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][Right][ClearFace][.......]
[Pause]
[LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadArc][FarLeft][LoadUzkalis]
You're here. Good. We can begin. Many of the[NL]
mountain passes from the Altian mainland[A][NL]
down to Cesaria are treacherous. I would[NL]
rather not have any huge forces in there[A][NL]
at a time, to prevent risking too many[NL]
soldiers in avalanches or ambushes.[A]
[Right][MoveLeft]That makes sense. So small strike forces[NL]
will move through the pass and[NL][A]
assemble on the Cesarian plains?[A]
[FarLeft]Correct. With any luck, I will meet you there.[NL]
Xavus intends to force his way through[A][NL]
the border with Arcanae and meet us. If that[NL]
fails, he will serve as a distraction[A][NL]
and we'll move straight for their[NL]
throat at the capital.[A]
[Left]So there's a backup plan.[A]
[Right][LoadLuke]You'd sacrifice half the[NL]
New Arcanian army for this?[A]
[FarRight]Luke, this is war. Not[NL]
your sheltered dying religion.[A][ClearFace][LoadElanil]
Woah. Go easy on him.[NL]
We're all a little tense.[A][Right][ClearFace]
[Left]I'll set out right away[NL]
hopefully to clear the way.[A]
[FarLeft]One moment. I'd like you to have[NL]
a slightly beefier army. Val! Helmer![A]
[Right][LoadHelmer][FarRight][LoadVal]Sergeant Val, reporting in.[A][Left][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
[FarLeft]Accompany [Tact] here. You will move[NL]
to the Altian border with Cesaria,[A][NL]
and from there, prepare an attack on[NL]
Cesaria. I will meet you once I[A][NL]
organize the rest of the forces here.[A]
[FarRight]Understood. It is a pleasure[NL]
to meet you, [Tact].[A]
[Left]Likewise. What are your strengths?[A]
[FarRight]I'm a dark mage. Just an[NL]
average Arcanian soldier.[A]
[Left]What about you, er...?[A]
[Right]Helmer. Corporal Helmer. I'm not[NL]
a mage, sir, but I like to think[A][NL]
I'm fairly handy with a lance.[A]
[Left]I understand.[Smile] It will[NL]
be good to have you both.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]Fightin' alongside with Arcanians...[NL]
Sure is a funny world.[A]
[FarLeft]Perfect.[Smile] I will meet you with my[NL]
own force after making it through[A][NL]
the pass. Good luck, [Tact].[A][X]
