[MidRight][LoadPlayer][MidLeft][LoadArya]
[Tact]! You're supposed to be[NL]
heading to the meeting![A]
[MidRight]I'm on my way, sorry![A]
[MidLeft]Here, I'll walk with you. Leon shared the[NL]
meeting room location with me yesterday.[A]
[MidRight]Thanks, Arya. It's my first time[NL]
in a castle quite this size, I'm[A][NL]
finding it hard to find my way around.[A]
[MidLeft]The Temple on Shizon is filled with[NL]
underground chambers. It's said to be of a[A][NL]
civilization older than Vathryl, but our leader[NL]
doesn't really tell us a whole lot about it.[A]
[MidRight]Does that ever concern you?[A]
[MidLeft]Not really. Our leader, Xexim,[NL]
is honorable. We all trust him[A][NL]
with our lives and livelihoods.[A]
[MidRight]Why are you still here, anyway? I know[NL]
you wanted to see where this went, but I[A][NL]
think you've seen exactly where it's going.[A]
[MidLeft]Shizon may be a country of assassins[NL]
working for pay, but we actually heavily[A][NL]
advocate peace. Xexim has been looking to[NL]
end this conflict without interfering.[A]
[MidRight]Why can't he directly step in?[A]
[MidLeft]For one, Shizon lacks the manpower. We[NL]
may be skilled at one-on-one combat, but[A][NL]
we're not an organized fighting force, and[NL]
certainly don't have a huge quantity of[A][NL]
fighters. Additionally, Shizon has a set of[NL]
rules that we swear an oath to when we[A][NL]
join the order. They've existed for a long[NL]
time, and Xexim would rather cling to[A][NL]
those rules rather than forget the morals[NL]
we live by. One of those rules is we[A][NL]
can't directly intervene in the affairs[NL]
of nations. We can take pay to do jobs[A][NL]
for them, but nothing else.[A]
[MidRight]And you being here isn't[NL]
a direct intervention?[A]
[MidLeft]Adlez has been paying me. It's a[NL]
loophole in the system. Xexim wouldn't[A][NL]
use it himself, but I certainly can.[A]
[MidRight]I see... Well, I'm glad you're on our[NL]
side. You've proven very resourceful.[A]
[MidLeft]Glad to be of assistance. Here's the meeting[NL]
chamber. I think Leon has a plan.[A][X]
