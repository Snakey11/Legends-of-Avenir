[MidRight][LoadZalius][MidLeft][LoadRex]
They're in the city?[A]
[MidRight]As our spies report, yes. Jurgen is[NL]
keeping the main force at the border[NL][A]
with assistance from my brigade.[A]
[MidLeft]Has Maximus made it away[NL]
with the Emperor?[A]
[MidRight]Yes. Leyos is with them too.[A]
[MidLeft]Good. [Smile]I have confidence we can[NL]
stop this strike force here,[A][NL]
just us and the Dragon Brigade.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]I would agree. Maximus did speak[NL]
very highly of that [Smile][Tact] fellow.[A][NL]
Hopefully we'll be able to[NL]
come to an agreement.[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Perhaps. But the Arcanians and Altians will[NL]
die. Their betrayal will go unforgiven.[A]
[MidRight]Leave it to me. I'll command the front[NL]
lines, with your permission, sir?[A]
[MidLeft]Please, Zalius, drop the formalities.[NL]
We've been comrades for too[A][NL]
long for rank to mean anything.[A]
[MidRight]You know me. Protocol is important,[NL]
especially at a time like this.[A]
[MidLeft]You have my permission to lead the front lines,[NL]
Zalius. I will command from back here. If[A][NL]
the going gets tough, fall back. You[NL]
aren't worth losing here, old friend.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Of course. Thank you, General.[NL]
Let's pay our friends a visit...[A][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]So it begins... Maximus,[NL]
keep the emperor safe...[A][X]
