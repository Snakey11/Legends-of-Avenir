Luke, Arc. Thank you for travelling with me.[NL]
It makes me far more comfortable[A][NL]
to have people I can thoroughly rely on.[A]
[Right]I just hope you haven't[NL]
signed our death warrants...[A]
[FarRight]I just wish to travel the[NL]
world. Arc... I'm sorry.[A]
[Right]It doesn't matter. I'm gonna get some[NL]
sleep. Wake me up in the morning.[A][ClearFace]
[FarRight][MoveMidRight]He always felt a sense of duty towards[NL]
Danaan. Knowing he failed trying to[A][NL]
ensure their safety forever...[....][NL]
I can't imagine...[A]
[MidLeft]Its not his fault. I was foolish to[NL]
not immediately set back for Danaan after[A][NL]
Adlez' death. Get some rest, Luke. We've[NL]
got a long few days ahead of us.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Thank you.[A][X]
