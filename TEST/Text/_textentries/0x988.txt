[MidLeft][LoadNarrator][MidRight][LoadPlayer]What the...? Who are you?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't recall? [Smile]Good. I must say,[NL]
[Tact]... You gave me more[A][NL]
entertainment than I've had since I got[NL]
this job. Becoming an assassin was[A][NL]
a rather bold move on your part.[A]
[MidRight]You're... The Guardian Spirit. It's[NL]
all coming back... If what Xexim says[A][NL]
is true, you haven't been the[NL]
Guardian Spirit for very long.[A]
[MidLeft]You're right, of course.[NL]
Was it worth it?[A]
[MidRight]How do you mean?[A]
[MidLeft]Did you enjoy your new[NL]
life, lost soul?[A]
[MidRight]I suppose you could say that. What[NL]
do you gain from this, though?[A]
[MidLeft][Smile]Only souls of extreme power[NL]
are able to seperate from their[A][NL]
bodies as yours.[A]
[MidRight]So what?[A]
[MidLeft]I needed a spark. That war was going[NL]
to go on forever. But unfortunately,[A][NL]
it was only worth the entertainment. There[NL]
are rules for me, you see. I can't[A][NL]
manipulate the events of Avenir. But, I[NL]
can kill you. And I can control time.[A][NL]
If I kill you here and roll time back to[NL]
before I gave you this new life,[A][NL]
I have nothing to worry about.[A]
[MidRight]Wait...[A]
[MidLeft]Don't worry. You'll have another[NL]
opportunity to make your mark.[A][NL]
Until then... Goodbye, [Tact][A][X]
