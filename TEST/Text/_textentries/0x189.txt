[MidRight][LoadPlayer][MidLeft][LoadRex]
You're one of the Haedricians...?[A]
[MidRight]Yes. You are General Rex, correct?[A]
[MidLeft]That would be me. Why[NL]
do you stop to talk?[A]
[MidRight]I know the futility of my efforts. The[NL]
point of this battle was not to win.[A]
[MidLeft]You had hoped to accomplish something...[NL]
Ah... Yes... I was wondering what reason[A][NL]
one would have for antagonizing[NL]
both us and Arcanae.[A]
[MidRight]We wanted you to be forced to work together.[NL]
This war has gone on long enough, with[A][NL]
little progress on either side. You know,[NL]
as I know, that it will not end[A][NL]
soon without a catalyst.[A]
[MidLeft]You sought to be that catalyst... Yes, I[NL]
see. I cannot make any gaurantees that[A][NL]
your ideals will come true, but I can at[NL]
the very least rpomise you that I will[A][NL]
remember this conversation well...[A]
[MidRight]Now, we are not here to[NL]
talk. En garde, General![A][X]
