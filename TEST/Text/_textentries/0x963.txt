[FarLeft][LoadVal][Right][LoadLuke][FarRight][LoadPlayer][Left][LoadOfficial]Excuse me? May I[NL]
see your buisness papers?[A]
[Right]My papers?[....] [LoadLuke]How[NL]
dare you! I'm a duke.[A]
[Left]My appologies. May I see[NL]
your lineage papers then?[A]
[Right]Lineage papers?[....] They were...[.....] stolen.[A]
[Left]Stolen?[A]
[Right]Yes! Stolen. Would you believe it?[NL]
I was on a mission to convert those[A][NL]
ruthless, northern barbarians[NL]
when my caravan was ambushed.[A]
[FarLeft]How terrible![A]
[Right]My entire guard was killed, and I[NL]
barely escaped. My caravan was looted[A][NL]
of everything. I had enough on me to hire[NL]
these mercenaries to escort me[A][NL]
back home. I'm just releasing[NL]
them now. You're all dismissed.[A]
[FarRight][TMM]...[......] [TMM]Very well.[A][ClearFace]
[Left]And you've traveled all the way down to[NL]
the southern coast from Haedric?[A][NL]
[Smile]You must have past by the capital.[A]
[Right]My realm is just further down the coast.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveMidRight]
I'm staying here tonight,[NL]
and I'll be home by tomorrow.[A]
[FarLeft]We're going that way too.[NL][Left][Smile][FarLeft]
[Smile]Please let us accompany you.[A]
[Left]Val, you will learn to be[NL]
less trusting of strangers.[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]Sorry, sir. You're right.[A]
[Left]You're the duke here, eh? You're[NL]
subservient to Uzkalis here, right?[A]
[MidRight]What? This is Muriel's domain.[NL]
I question your own validity.[A]
[Left][Smile]Very fair. Merely a test, my friend.[NL]
On your way, then, and my[A][NL]
appologies for your misfortunes.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Thank you for understanding.[....] Farewell.[A]
[Left]Farewell.[....] Come, Val.[A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][.......]I think the coast is clear.[A][CloseSpeech][......][MoveMidLeft]
[FarRight][LoadArya][Right][LoadPlayer]That was close.[A]
[MidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke][Smile]I'm really glad I got that[NL]
book on global politics.[A]
[Right]Yeah. Really. Arya,[NL]
when will he be here?[A]
[FarRight]I really don't know exactly, but he'd[NL]
never lie to me. We just need[A][NL]
to lay low until he arrives.[A][X]
