Maximus is deploying his men...[A]
[MidLeft]I am not surprised. He[NL]
knows we'll make a move soon.[A]
[MidRight]These battles along the border have[NL]
gone on long enough. Maximus' strategy[A][NL]
is strong. Uzkalis, I need you[NL]
to return to the capital.[A]
[MidLeft]Xavus?[A]
[MidRight]There are only the two of us.[NL]
Cesaria has multiple captains and[A][NL]
brigades. We can't let them slip[NL]
through to our center of power.[A]
[MidLeft]I understand. Good[NL]
luck, my friend.[A][ClearFace]
[MidRight]Now, Maximus...[Smile] Are you[NL]
ready to know pain?[A][X]
