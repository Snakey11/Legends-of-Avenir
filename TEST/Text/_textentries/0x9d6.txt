[FarLeft][LoadDerek][Left][LoadJasper][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadLux]
Well done! Derek, Jasper,[NL]
secure this position![A]
[FarLeft]Understood![A]
[Left]Will do![A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][Right]
Arc, would you [MidLeft][LoadArc][Right]lend them a hand?[A]
[MidLeft]It would be my pleasure.[A][ClearFace][....]
[Left][LoadElanil][FarLeft][LoadFinoc][Tact]! You're here![A]
[Right]Finoc! Elanil! Thanks for the help back[NL]
there! What brings you here?[A]
[Left]The Anguis told us that Altia is going to[NL]
side with Cesaria in this conflict. We[A][NL]
were dispatched to rejoin with you. Didn't[NL]
expect to find you out here in Draterus.[A]
[Right]We joined up with Cesaria too.[NL]
Finoc, Elanil, this is Lux, Vice[A][NL]
Captain of the Tiger Brigade.[A]
[FarRight]It's a pleasure to meet you both. Thank[NL]
you for joining this conflict on our side.[A]
[FarLeft]It was the decision of Anguis and High[NL]
Priest Izuk. We're just following orders.[A]
[FarRight]I still thank you for your assistance. I[NL]
will send a messenger bird to Captain Maximus[A][NL]
at the capital to inform him and the rest[NL]
of the leadership of this new development.[A][ClearFace][.....][LoadLuke][Smile]
Elanil! Finoc! You're here.[A]
[Left]Luke! It's good to see you. Didn't[NL]
realize it would be so soon.[A]
[FarLeft]Looks like we're all back together.[NL]
Care to fill us in, [Tact]?[A][FarRight][Smile]
[Right]Sure thing. Uzkalis and his branch of the[NL]
Arcanian military has fled into Draterus.[A][NL]
They were using this Oasis as a sort of base[NL]
camp, so we decided to strike here first[A][NL]
to make the rest of them easy pickings.[A]
[FarLeft]I see. Where is Uzkalis now?[A]
[Right]Likely exploring ruins[NL]
hoping to find artifacts.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadJasper]
[Tact]! It looks like some of the[NL]
enemies got away! Their tracks[A][NL]
are leading south, towards Bacrun.[A]
[Right]Bacrun? Damn, they're going to try[NL]
and sever the connection between[A][NL]
the nations. Where's Lux?[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadLux]
I'm here. What's going on?[A]
[FarRight]A portion of Uzkalis' forces[NL]
are headed towards Bacrun.[A]
[FarLeft]Dammit. We'll have to move quickly.[NL]
Everyone! We head south for Bacrun![A]
[FarRight]Yes sir![A]
[Right]I hope we haven't made a mistake by[NL]
targeting the men at the oasis...[A][X]
