[MidRight][LoadPlayer]
So this is a peaceful world... I've not[NL]
passed one military caravan in weeks.[A]
[Pause]
[MidLeft][LoadNarrator]
Quite something, isn't it?[A]
[MidRight]Wha- Where did you come from?[A]
[MidLeft]Oh, I've always been here.[NL]
Watching. Listening. You've put[A][NL]
on quite the good show, [Tact].[A]
[MidRight]I don't understand what[NL]
you're saying. Who are you?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't know? Or, more appropriately,[NL]
you don't remember? I'm the one[A][NL]
that gave you this life, lost soul.[A]
[MidRight]Wait... I do have a[NL]
vague recollection...[A]
[MidLeft]Must I spell it out for you? I[A] A[.]-M[A][NL]
T[.]-H[.]-E[A] G[.]-U[.]-A[.]-R[.]-D[.]-I[.]-A[.]-N[A] S[.]-P[.]-I[.]-R[.]-I[.]-T.[A]
[MidRight]The Guardian Spirit... Kilthel?[A]
[MidLeft]Nonono, Efil destroyed him ten years ago.[NL]
I'm Kilthel's replacement.[A][NL]
We're pretty slow today, no?[A]
[MidRight]So why are you here aside[NL]
from playing with me?[A]
[MidLeft]Play with you? You really have it figured[NL]
out, don't you? Alas, all toys must come[A][NL]
to an end. You see, it goes against my[NL]
oath as Guardian Spirit to impact the[A][NL]
events of the world, and unfortunately,[NL]
you've caused me to break that oath.[A][NL]
So here's the deal. I kill you. Then,[NL]
I roll time back to before you[A][NL]
were ever given this new life.[A]
[MidRight]Wait a minute![A]
[MidLeft]No.[A][X]
