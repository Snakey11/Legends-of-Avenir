[Left][LoadLux][Right][LoadPlayer]
I would have expected Uzkalis to have[NL]
struck by now. What's going on?[A]
[FarRight][LoadFinoc]I'll fly out and see what I can see.[A]
[Left]Thank you Finoc.[FarRight][ClearFace][Left][....][Pause][Left] Luke, can [FarLeft][LoadLuke][Left]you go around and[NL]
make sure the nearby villagers are taken[A][NL]
care of? We may have caused more[NL]
destruction here than intended.[A]
[FarLeft]Will do.[A][CloseSpeech][ClearFace][Left][MoveMidLeft]
Elanil,[FarRight][LoadElanil][MidLeft] [Tact], we need to talk.[A]
[Right]What's our plan?[A]
[MidLeft]We can't let Uzkalis escape. This is our[NL]
chance. We have to start moving now.[A]
[FarRight][LoadElanil]Before Finoc returns? That doesn't[NL]
make any strategic sense.[A]
[Right]I agree with Elanil.[A]
[MidLeft]We can at the very least start moving back[NL]
towards Draterus. Finoc has sharp eyes and[A][NL]
better mobility than the rest of us.[NL]
It's a risk I believe we must take.[A]
[Right]What about Maximus? Did he ever[NL]
send a reply to your message?[A]
[MidLeft]That would be unlike any Cesarian captain,[NL]
including him. They receive countless updates[A][NL]
a day, especially those in the field. It[NL]
would be a waste of time for him to[A][NL]
reply to each one. No, we must take[NL]
care of this ourselves.[A]
[FarRight]Very well then. I'll notify the others[NL]
that we'll be setting out soon.[A]
[MidLeft]Immediately. We'll be setting out immediately.[A]
[FarRight]So be it.[A][ClearFace][Right]
Are you sure about this, Lux?[A]
[MidLeft]Positively. If we catch up to Uzkalis[NL]
and put an end to him, this war will end[A][NL]
that much faster. I received word from the[NL]
Vice-Captain of the Lion Brigade that[A][NL]
Captain Jurgen recently pushed Xavus back[NL]
towards the Arcanian capital. We have[A][NL]
to keep Xavus and Uzkalis separate,[NL]
or else they'll unite their forces.[A]
[Right]I understand. We have to go then.[A]
[MidLeft]Indeed. Better now than never.[A][X]
