This is it...[A]
[FarLeft]I stand with you, Efil. I[NL]
know this is hard for you.[A]
[Right][Smile]Yes. But I had friends ten years ago,[NL]
and I have friends now. Thank you, all.[A]
[Left][Smile]No, thank you. I've dreamed of this[NL]
day for years. Now I can see it happen.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]I'm not one for emotions, but...[NL]
I'm glad to be able to make a difference.[A][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
I'm with Baret. We stand by you, Efil.[A][ClearFace][LoadVicar]
Never thought I'd see those two beat me to[NL]
the punch... I never would have thought[A][NL]
joining a raid would lead us here, but[NL]
here we are. I'll give it my all.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArya]
I am here for my pay, yes. But I believe[NL]
this is what Xexim and all of Shizon[A][NL]
would want. So here I stand.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadKendrick]
You made a difference in my life ten years[NL]
ago, Efil. Because of that, I was able[A][NL]
to change. Now I can repay that by supporting[NL]
you. It's a lucrative opportunity that[A][NL]
I'd be fool to skip out on.[A]
[Right]You all... You've known me for very little[NL]
time, and yet you place your trust in me. I[A][NL]
hope to not fail you all... Let's end this.[A][X]
