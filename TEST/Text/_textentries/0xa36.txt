You need supplies for a trip into[NL]
the desert? That seems like a[A][NL]
pointless investment for me.[A]
[FarRight]We'll pay you up front. You[NL]
lose nothing whether we live or not.[A]
[MidLeft]No, but I can't count on[NL]
you as a returning customer.[A]
[FarRight]I can see you won't change your mind.[A][CloseSpeech][MidLeft][ClearFace][Right][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
What now, Vicar? These merchants seem to be[NL]
guarding their merchandise heavily.[A][FarLeft][LoadArya][Right][LoadAdlez][FarRight]
News travels quickly. They may suspect us,[NL]
and selling goods to the wrong person[A][NL]
can cause a lot of trouble for merchants.[A]
[FarLeft]Looks like some men over[NL]
there are eyeing us...[A]
[FarRight]Bounty hunters... Damn.[NL]
They must have recognized Adlez.[A]
[Right]I'm sorry, I should have stayed behind.[A]
[Left]We weren't willing to[NL]
leave you on your own.[A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadMason]
You there! State your business![A][CloseSpeech][FarRight][MoveRight]
We're a group of mercenaries, looking[NL]
for supplies for a journey into[A][NL]
Draterus. What's it to you?[A]
[FarLeft]What are your names?[A]
[FarRight]I'm-[A][Events]
[FarFarLeft]Mason! There you are![A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveLeft][FarLeft][Smile][LoadKendrick]
What's the matter? Oh, Mason. This band is[NL][FarRight][ClearFace][FarLeft]
trustworthy, I hired them to go into[A][NL]
Draterus to find more treasures for[NL]
my ever expanding business.[A][Right][MoveFarRight][Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadMason]
Kendrick, you know I'm suspicious[NL]
wherever you're involved.[A][NL]
Someone like you never changes.[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveLeft]
Except I have. I'm a businessman, Mason.[NL]
Leave us be to discuss our business. You're[A][NL]
a bounty hunter, right? Is there[NL]
a bounty here for you?[A]
[Right]...[.....] No.[A]
[Left]Then leave us be.[NL]
'Til next time, friend.[A]
[Right]Very well.[A][ClearFace][......][FarRight][MoveRight]
Thank you for helping us out.[A][Left]
No problem. I'm Kendrick, a businessman[NL]
travelling around Avenir. Temporarily in[A][NL]
Bacrun to expand my market. You all are?[A]
[Right]I'm Vicar. These two are Walter and Baret,[NL][FarLeft][LoadWalter][FarRight][LoadBaret][Right]
my close companions. We three are a small[A][NL]
mercenary group, joined with the rest here.[A]
[FarLeft]Good to meet your acquaintance![A][ClearFace][LoadArya]
[FarRight]Hello...[A][ClearFace][LoadAdlez]
[FarLeft]My name's Arya. I'm a Shizonian hired by-[A][FarRight][LoadAdlez]
Shh![A]
[Left]Is there a problem?[A]
[FarRight]No, no problem. We feel it's best to[NL]
keep secret who Arya was hired by.[A][FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
[Left]Understandable. And your name?[A]
[FarRight]I'm-[A]
[Left]Adlez, yes I know, I've[NL]
seen the wanted posters.[A]
[FarRight]...[......] Oh.[A]
[FarLeft]I'm [Tact]. Just a[NL]
freelancer travelling with them.[A]
[Left]I see. I heard about you from[NL]
one of my suppliers. Said[A][NL]
you were planning on going[NL]
into Draterus, right?[A]
[FarLeft]That's correct.[A]
[Left]Not many attempt that journey... The[NL]
Wanderers are ruthless towards intruders.[A]
[Right]We know, but we need to get[NL]
to the Temple of Kilthel.[A]
[Left]I see... I have the supplies you need,[NL]
but I'm not willing to just provide them.[A]
[FarLeft]We have money.[A]
[Left]If I wanted money, I'd just turn[NL]
Adlez over here in and collect[A][NL]
the reward. I deal in goods, not in[NL]
money, and certainly not in people.[A]
[FarRight]Then...?[A][Events]
[Left]I'm travelling with you. There could be some[NL]
goods out there that I could find handy. We[A][NL]
go to your Temple, you do... Whatever it[NL]
is you do, and I find my goods. Deal?[A]
[FarLeft]I'm good with it. Vicar? Adlez?[A]
[Right]He seems trustworthy. I say it's[NL]
the best offer we'll get.[A]
[FarRight]I agree. Now we just have to[NL]
get out of here. If Kendrick[A][NL]
recognized me, that means-[A]
[FarFarLeft]There they still are! Assemble men![A]
[Left]Dammit.[A][X]
