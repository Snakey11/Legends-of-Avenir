[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadArc][FarRight][LoadLuke]May you rest in peace,[.] Gerwick...[A][NL]
[Right]There you are, Luke.[NL]
[Tact], this is Luke.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Wait. I thought you all hated Gerwick.[A][NL]
[Right]He was a scoundrel and a dishonest man,[NL]
but he was still from Danaan.[A][NL]
We always honor our own...[.......][NL]
Where will you be going now?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I thought I might go to seek out more work.[NL]
Do you know of any jobs around here?[A][NL]
[Right]We're actually sending a caravan to the[NL]
capital to request a Warlord again.[A][NL]
Given the dangers we face now between[NL]
Arcanae and any of Gerwick's friends,[A][NL]
I thought Basileus Leon might listen[NL]
this time.[.....] I was planning on[A][NL]
accompanying it,[.] but we can always use[NL]
the extra manpower. With Gerwick gone,[A][NL]
I suppose the town is safe for now.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Sounds like a deal to me.[A][NL]
[FarRight]I want to come too. I feel as though[NL]
there's a truth I need to find.[A][NL]
Why did Gerwick do the things he did?[NL]
What is the source of his evil?[A][NL]
[Right]You're askin' yourself[NL]
impossible questions there, Luke.[A][NL]
[FarRight]I don't care. More and more I've felt[NL]
that the path I've chosen for[A][NL]
myself isn't entirely true...[....][A][NL]
[MidLeft]Great. I wouldn't mind journeying[NL]
with a group for awhile. I get[A][NL]
lonely working alone sometimes.[A][NL]
[FarRight]Thank you...[......] Shall we be off then?[A][NL]
[Right]Let's wait until the morning. There's[NL]
another merchant planning to arrive[A][NL]
this evening on his way to the capital,[NL]
and I figured we could travel with[A][NL]
him and his entourage, maybe[NL]
boost our numbers a bit more.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]It's a plan. Let's all meet[NL]
in the morning then, shall we?[A][NL]
[FarRight]Yes.[A][NL]
[Right]Deal.[A][X]
