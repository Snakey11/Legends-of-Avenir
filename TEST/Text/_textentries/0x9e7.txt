Look! There they are! Seems that Finoc found[NL]
them first. They seem to be in trouble![A]
[Right]We have to meet up with them and then take[NL]
out Uzkalis while we have the chance![A]
[Left]I never would have guessed that one of my[NL]
first assignments after graduating[A][NL]
was taking out one of the two[NL]
greatest enemies of Cesaria.[A]

we'll get some honor for this.[A][ClearFace][Left][ClearFace][MidLeft][LoadElanil]
Focus, you two! This battle is more[NL]
important than just honor. This[A][NL]
could turn the tide of the war.[A]
[Right]Thank you, Elanil. [Tact],[NL]

[FarRight]Absolutely. Let's put Uzkalis[NL]
in his place and help Maximus.[A][X]
