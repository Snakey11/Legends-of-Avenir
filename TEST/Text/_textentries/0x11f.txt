Uzkalis! What a surprise. What's the word?[A]
[MidLeft]Not great. I need to speak with you and Val.[NL]
Maximus has holed his brigade, with the[A][NL]
Emperor, up in the Temple of Kilthel.[A]
[FarRight]Kilthel... The former Guardian Spirit?[A]
[MidLeft]Correct. He was dispelled ten years ago by the[NL]
hero known as Efil, who still resides in the[A][NL]
inner sanctum of the temple. But those[NL]
gates are sealed, so our foe[A][NL]
has trapped themselves.[A]
[Right]What's the catch?[A]
[MidLeft]Leyos, the former General of the Cesarian[NL]
Military, is with them. He's acting as the[A][NL]
Emperor's bodyguard. He's definitely a[NL]
foe to be reckoned with.[A]
[FarRight]Not to mention Maximus. He was known for his[NL]
hard work and training when he first rose[A][NL]
to Lieutenant, or so Helmer told me.[A]
[MidLeft]Correct. Xavus has defeated Jurgen and the[NL]
brigades at the border, and is moving to[A][NL]
the capital now. He wants us to return with[NL]
the Emperor's corpse before he gets there[A][NL]
so that none can contest his victory.[A]
[FarRight]So our only choice is to[NL]
charge into the Temple.[A]
[Right]Doesn't sound like our advantage. They[NL]
have numbers, a defensive position,[A][NL]
and two extremely strong warriors.[A]
[MidLeft]Indeed. The outer sanctum is rich with[NL]
treacherous terrain and traps. The[A][NL]
Vathrylians who created it always had a[NL]
way with making their temples into[A][NL]
elaborate death traps.[A]
[FarRight]That doesn't sound great for us...[NL]
What's your plan, Uzkalis?[A]
[MidLeft]We have no choice. We have to go in. I[NL]
plan on joining you in battle, of[A][NL]
course. I am the most [Smile]powerful[NL]
Thunder Mage in Avenir, anyway.[A]
[Right]You're sure?[A]
[MidLeft]You managed to defeat Rex, Zalius,[NL]
and the Dragon Brigade without me.[A][NL]
I have faith in you and your friends.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadFinoc]
[Tact]! It looks like the whole[NL]
brigade has entered the Temple[A][NL]
of Kilthel. Wait, Uzkalis?[A]
[Left]I just brought them up to speed[NL]
from my own expedition.[A]
[FarLeft]Ah, I see. So we have a plan?[A]
[Right]Almost...[A]
[FarLeft]So about as much of a plan as we normally[NL]
have. Well, you haven't led us astray[A][NL]
yet, [Smile][Tact]. I'll follow you.[A]
[Right][Smile]Thank you Finoc.[A]
[FarRight]I'm with you as well. When we first set[NL]
out, I wasn't sure what to make of you.[A][NL]
But you have honor and respect. You also[NL][Smile]
allowed Helmer and I to understand each[A][NL]
other better. My magic is yours to command.[A]
[Right]Val...[A]
[Left]It's time. Round up the others.[NL]
We can't delay any longer.[A]
[Right]Understood.[A][X]
