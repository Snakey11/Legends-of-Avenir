[MidLeft][LoadArc][MidRight][LoadArya]Your name is Arc, correct?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]What's it to you?[A][NL]
[MidRight]You're my target. Get ready.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Wait! Me specifically?[A][NL]
[MidRight]That is what I was told to do.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]What kind of bandit are you?[NL]
Firstly, you're a girl.[A][NL]
Secondly, you have a target?[A][NL]
[MidRight]I am an assassin of Shizon. I will[NL]
kill whomever my employer orders me to.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]This seems to be below the typical[NL]
jobs you Shizonians take on.[A][NL]
[MidRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]I may lack confidence in my orders,[NL]
but my contract is my contract.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]If your contract stated something[NL]
different than this, is it still valid?[A][NL]
[MidRight]What?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I'm just a simple militiaman.[NL]
I'm no scholar, and certainly not an[A][NL]
assassin, but I figure that if Gerwick's[NL]
ole pal over there misled you, you'd[A][NL]
have the right to leave him, no? Plus,[NL]
Gerwick, your employer is dead.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Gerwick is dead?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]By our own hands.[NL]
Wouldn't that terminate your contract?[A][NL]
[MidRight]Then I'm no longer[NL]
bound to these bandits.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]How about this? How about I[NL]
contract you for our side?[A][NL]
[MidRight][TMM][.......]... [.......][TMM]I'll take any opportunity to get[NL][Smile]
back at these misleading thugs.[A][NL][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]Wow,[.] can't believe that worked.[A][X]
