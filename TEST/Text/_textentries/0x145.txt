Finally, you're alone again.[A]
[MidRight]What the hell!? Who are you!?[A]
[MidLeft]You don't have any recollection? I[NL]
gave you this life, you know.[A]
[MidRight]I have a... vague recollection. Yes.[NL]
I felt like this life just kind of[A][NL]
suddenly started. Was that you?[A]
[MidLeft]Yes, that would be the fault of yours truly,[NL]
the Guardian Spirit. You were a lost soul,[A][NL]
so I decided I'd give you a new life. Always[NL]
entertaining to see what a one can do.[A]
[MidRight]So what are you doing here?[A]
[MidLeft]Ah yes, you see... By the contract[NL]
that gives me the power of the Guardian[A][NL]
Spirit, I can't directly influence the[NL]
events of the world too greatly. Your part[A][NL]
in this war... Well, it kind of messed that[NL]
up. But I can roll time back to before[A][NL]
giving you this new life. The only issue[NL]
is what to do about you...[A]
[MidRight]You don't mean...[A]
[MidLeft]Sorry, [Tact]. It's nothing[NL]
personal. Just good business.[A][X]
