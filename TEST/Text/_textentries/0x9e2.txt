Maintaining independence from this war[NL]
has been difficult, especially when[A][NL]
Bacrun lies right on the edge of both[NL]
Cesaria and Arcanae. But I never[A][NL]
thought one side would actually make a[NL]
move to use any part of Bacrun for[A][NL]
their purposes in this war... Take this,[NL]
and get rid of them. Many of[A][NL]
us came here to escape the[NL]
war, not be dragged into it.[A][X]
