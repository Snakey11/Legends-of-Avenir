[FarLeft][LoadArya][Right][LoadVicar][Left][LoadPlayer]
Are we all here?[A]
[FarLeft]Looks like it. The Wanderers are out[NL]
there en masse, though. They'll probably[A][NL]
be storming in here any minute now...[A]
[Left]We'll have to find Efil, then.[NL]
Vicar, can you watch our back?[A]
[Right]Of course. Baret, Walter, you're with me.[A]
[FarRight][LoadBaret]Understood.[A][ClearFace][LoadWalter]
Okay...[A]
[Right]Everything okay, Walter?[A]
[FarRight]Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit of a rush[NL]
there. They appeared so suddenly...[A]
[Right]They did indeed... We'll have to keep a[NL]
sharp lookout. There's a good chance[A][NL]
there are many passages and areas in this[NL]
temple that we don't know about, but[A][NL]
the Wanderers do. We'll keep watch over[NL]
the main entrance, but stay safe.[A]
[Left]We will. Catch up quickly[NL]
if you have to, Vicar.[A]
[Right]Will do. Good luck finding Efil.[A][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[Left]So what do you know about this Temple,[NL]
Arya? The Shizonians seem to know a[A][NL]
lot more than the rest [FarRight][LoadKendrick][Left]of the world.[A]
[FarLeft]I don't know a lot, I'm afraid. Efil was[NL]
the hero who resolved the unbalance[A][NL]
between Vene, the magical energy of the world,[NL]
and Inge, the natural energy of the world.[A][NL]
This was supposedly the temple where it[NL]
came to a head between Efil and his allies[A][NL]
and the Guardian Spirit, Kilthel, but I[NL]
don't truly understand the conflict myself.[A]
[FarRight]The whole event had a very small impact[NL][Right][LoadAdlez][FarRight]
on most people's daily lives. It created a[NL]
temporary cease-fire between Arcanae and[A][NL]
Cesaria, but aside from that, most people[NL]
don't realize how close Avenir came to[A][NL]
becoming just one big desert.[A]
[Right]How do you know about it, Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight]I encountered Efil a few times on his[NL]
journey. [Smile]Plus, I make it my business to[A][NL]
know everybody else's business. The[NL]
more you know, the more you profit.[A]
[Left]Are you a businessman or a[NL]
criminal, Kendrick?[A]
[FarRight][LoadKendrick][Smile]I'm an honest businessman![NL]
[Smile]Just... a clever one.[A]
[Right]Any useful information you have[NL]
for us then, Mr. Pinnacle of Honesty?[A]
[FarRight]Efil has a strong sense of morality. He[NL]
doesn't want to intervene in the affairs[A][NL]
of the world if he doesn't have to. So he[NL]
stays all the way out here, in the middle[A][NL]
of nowhere. The Wanderers despise him,[NL]
though. It's possible they intend[A][NL]
to use us to have him lower his guard...[A]
[Left]What are they, anyway?[A]
[FarRight]The Wanderers? I don't really know. Arya?[A]
[FarLeft]I'm not the right one to ask either.[A]
[Right]I sure as hell don't know.[NL]
Probably a question for Efil.[A]
[Left]How do we find him, anyway?[A]
[FarLeft]Vathrylian Artifacts act as keys in their[NL]
temples. If we use the artifact we took[A][NL]
from Haedric, we should be able to open a[NL]
path to get out of this outer area.[A]
[FarRight]Artifact from Haedric?[A]
[Left]We stole an artifact from Haedric.[NL]
No, Kendrick, you can't have it.[A]
[FarRight]Damn, I was hopeful for a second there.[A]
[FarLeft]You didn't honestly think[NL]
we'd give it to you, right?[A]
[FarRight]I'm not an idiot. Besides, if that artifact[NL]
gets us into the inner temple, that gets us[A][NL]
closer to the potential treasures deeper[NL]
within this place. I've said I'm honest.[A]
[Right]Every "businessman" says that. On another[NL]
note, look there, at that wall.[A][X]
