This way. The Temple of Kilthel is near.[A]
[MidRight]Why have you done this? I should have[NL]
stayed and died. This is the coward's way.[A]
[MidLeft]I'm sorry, sir. No soldier in this army[NL]
would let that happen. There's the[A][NL]
entrance. The inner sanctum will be closed,[NL]
but we can take refuge in the[A][NL]
upper levels. Leyos![A][CloseSpeech][MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadLeyos]
Aye?[A]
[MidLeft]Take the Emperor inside. You're the personal[NL]
bodyguard, you need to be in charge of[A][NL]
his protection. Why am I the[NL]
one sending him here?[A]
[FarRight]Understood. I always find it[NL]
amusing how comfortable you are[A][NL]
ordering your former superior around.[A]
[MidLeft]You retired from the position of General.[NL]
It's fairly simple. I'm sure [Tact]'s men are[A][NL]
on to us, and Uzkalis is also likely moving[NL]
to intercept. Get the Emperor inside.[A]
[Right]I will not stand idly by![A]
[FarRight]Sorry, my lord, but if you want to die,[NL]
they'll have to get through us first.[A][X]
