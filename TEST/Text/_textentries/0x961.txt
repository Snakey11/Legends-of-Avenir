[FarRight][LoadPlayer][Right][LoadArc][Left][LoadLuke][FarLeft][LoadArya][Smile]I've made arrangements. I have some[NL]
acquaintances from Bacrun who are coming[A][NL]
here to finish escorting the caravan so that[NL]
we can get to Shizon. I've also made[A][NL]
arrangements with an old friend[NL]
to bring us over to Shizon.[A]
[Right]Why should I leave my hometown[NL][FarLeft][Smile][Right]
relatively defenseless? I don't[A][NL]
like this. How about you, Luke?[A]
[Left]I... I would like to go. I'm curious of[NL]
their culture, and I think staying in[A][NL]
Danaan is a dead end for me. I want [NL]
to travel and uncover the[A][NL]
secrets of enlightenment.[A][NL]
[Right]I need time to mull this over.[NL]
Where would we be heading?[A]
[FarLeft]Port Selsing, off the southern coast[NL]
of Arcanae. It's not ideal for heading[A][NL]
to Shizon, but any closer and it[NL]
requires Cesarian Royal Approval.[A]
[Right]I'd prefer not to travel through Arcanae.[A]
[FarLeft]We don't really have a choice.[A]
[Left]They won't know where we come from.[NL]
I can pose as an Arcanian Duke.[A]
[Right]Aye, I suppose that is a possibility.[A]
[FarRight]When will your friends be here, Arya?[A]
[FarLeft]I'm not sure.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadEscort]
Oi! There you are Arya![A]
[FarLeft]Here they are now.[A]
[FarRight][MoveRight]So what's the job?[A]
[FarLeft][MoveLeft]We just need you to escort the caravan[NL]
to the capital of Haedric[A][NL]
so we can head to Shizon.[A]
[Right][Smile]I can do that. I'll assume[NL]
pay will come upon arrival?[A]
[FarRight]If not, head to Danaan. Tell them Arc[NL]
sent you. Here's a quick letter of proof.[A]
[Right]I appreciate it. Where[NL]
are you all headed?[A]
[FarLeft]We're going-[A]
[Left]To Shizon. That's all[NL]
you need to know.[A]
[Right]Very fair. Very fair.[....][NL]
Good luck, my friends![A][X]
