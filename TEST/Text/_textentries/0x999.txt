We have to finish this quick. I'd like to[NL]
try and get that artifact from him.[A]
[Left]Agreed. I'm sure Altia has[NL]
no need for it.[A]
[FarLeft]I'd certainly be more comfortable with it[NL]
out of some barbarian's hands though...[A]
[MidRight]First things first, kill Adlez. We[NL]
can worry about the artifact later.[A][X]
