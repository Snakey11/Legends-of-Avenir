What a waste...[A]
[MidLeft][OpenEyes]Who...[....] are you?[A]
[MidRight]I am the one who gave you this[NL]
opportunity... And you squandered it.[A]
[MidLeft]I have...[....] A vague memory.[NL]
A blurry image...[A]
[MidRight]I am the Guardian Spirit. I gave you this[NL]
life, and what did you do? You wasted it. I[A][NL]
ought to leave you here for dead... But, I[NL]
have rules I must abide by. While it was[A][NL]
fun to watch what you did, as highly[NL]
disappointing as it was, my direct[A][NL]
intervention by giving you this life goes[NL]
against my oath. So, naturally, I must[A][NL]
kill you, and roll time back[NL]
to before your new life.[A]
[MidLeft]Just...[.....] Make it quick...[....][A]
[MidRight]Of course... Goodbye, [Tact].[A][X]
