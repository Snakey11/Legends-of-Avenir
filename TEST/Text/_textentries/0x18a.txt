[MidLeft][LoadRex]
What a waste...[A]
[MidRight][LoadXavus]Basileus Leon... The whole Haedrician[NL]
army. What were they thinking?[A]
[MidLeft]Xavus! What are you doing here?[A]
[MidRight]Calm down Rex, the truce still stands.[A]
[MidLeft]Indeed... What is it you want?[A]
[MidRight]These men... They were smart. They had lives.[NL]
And they sacrificed themself. For what?[A]
[MidLeft]They died fighting in the name of[NL]
peace. To try and stop our war...[A]
[MidRight]Rex, I'd like us to enter into negotiations.[NL]
I believe that... We can reach a[A][NL]
compromise. Without wasting more lives.[A]
[MidLeft]Yes... I agree. I will notify the Emperor[NL]
and pull my forces back. I'd advise you[A][NL]
do the same. I will leave some men here[NL]
to aid in the reconstruction of Bacrun.[A]
[MidRight]As will I. I believe the Council has the[NL]
funds to handle it, they just need the[A][NL]
manpower... I will also pull back.[A]
[MidLeft]It is an agreement then. [Smile]I look forward to[NL]
finally resolving this, after so long.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Yes, I agree. I wish you luck on your end.[A][X]
