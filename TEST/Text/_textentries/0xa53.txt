Maximus![A]
[MidLeft]Efil, why are you here? Leave.[NL]
You can't do anything here.[A]
[MidRight]Yes I can! Stop fighting! Can't[NL]
you see what this is doing to Avenir?[A]
[MidLeft]It is not my choice.[NL]
I am just a soldier.[A]
[MidRight]You have influence, and you know it.[A]
[MidLeft]I could withdraw, but Xavus would follow[NL]
us. This war is not one-sided,[A][NL]
Efil. Its never that simple.[A]
[MidRight]What if I talk to Xavus?[A]
[MidLeft]I swear on my honor that if you can[NL]
convince Xavus to withdraw, I will also[A][NL]
withdraw. But until that happens, this[NL]
battle continues. I'm sorry, Efil.[A][NL]
I wish that I could do more.[A][X]
