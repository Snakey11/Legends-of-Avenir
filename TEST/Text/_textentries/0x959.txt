[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadArya]You. Who are you?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I could ask you the same.[A][NL]
[MidRight]My name is Arya.[NL]
I am an assassin from Shizon.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Really? Banditry is more a[NL]
freelancer's job, not an assassin.[A][NL]
[MidRight]You've yet to answer my question.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I'm [Tact], a freelancer[NL]
hired to guard this caravan.[A][NL]
And I'm doing just that.[A][NL]
[MidRight]You seem to have honor...[......][NL]
Any sane person would know[A][NL]
this is a losing battle.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I believe this is a[NL]
conversation, not a fight.[A][NL]
[MidRight]I'm...[......] conflicted...[......][NL]
I'd rather not fight you.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Banditry seems below you.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Yes...[......] You're right.[NL]
Perhaps I'll join you for now.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Well...[......] We'd be honored to have you.[A][X]
