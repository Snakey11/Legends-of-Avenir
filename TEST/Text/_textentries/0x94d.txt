[FarRight][LoadGerwick]I think we've done enough damage,[NL]
boys! Let's head out![A][CloseSpeech][MoveFarLeft][ClearFace][.......][NL]
[FarRight][LoadArc]Damn! What a coward.[NL][Left][LoadLuke][FarLeft][LoadPlayer][FarRight]
We can't survive another attack.[A][NL]
Our militia is completely compromised.[A][NL]
[Left]Bless their souls. Their[NL]
suffering will be rewarded...[A][NL]
[FarRight]There you are,[.] Luke.[....][NL]
This is Luke,[.] [Tact].[A][NL]
What we need is a surprise attack on their[NL]
camp.[....] Catch them while they lick[A][NL]
their wounds.[.....] Unfortunately,[.] we can't[NL]
find the camp.[.....] All the scouts we've[A][NL]
sent out never came back.[A][NL]
[FarLeft]I'll help you out if[NL]
it'll solve your problem.[A][NL]
[FarRight]That would be deeply appreciated.[NL]
You will be compensated.[A][NL]
[Left]We lack the manpower,[.] though.[....] We can[NL]
probably gather the remnants of the[A][NL]
militia,[.] but we don't even know what[NL]
we're walking into.[.....] We don't even[A][NL]
know where they are![A][NL]
[FarLeft]I know this area pretty well.[NL]
I've got some ideas on where they[A][NL]
may be holed up.[A][NL]
[FarRight]If we attack tonight while they're[NL]
weakened, it may make up for our lack[A][NL]
in power.[......] Let's get ready.[A][X]
