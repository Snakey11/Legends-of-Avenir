What was that about?[A]
[MidLeft]He wants us to help raid a caravan. He[NL]
was impressed with what we did in Danaan.[A]
[FarRight]He talked to you about this?[A]
[Right]Baret, relax. A freelancer is more likely[NL]

I'm sure he has his reasons.[A]
[MidLeft]It's up to you if you want to actually join[NL]
us. He mentioned a Shizonian assassin too.[A]
[Right]A Shizonian? Adlez poured money into hiring[NL]
one of them? Interesting... I'd be[A][NL]
interested in seeing one of them fight.[A]
[MidLeft]So you'll come with?[A]
[Right]Why not? There's money in it, and a[NL]
chance to see a Shizonian in action.[A][NL]
This could prove very educational.[A]

I'll help you, Baret.[A]
[Right]No, both of you need your rest.[NL]
I'll get things ready.[A]
[FarRight]Oh... Thank you Vicar.[A]
[MidLeft]I'll get some rest too.[NL]
See you all in the morning.[A][X]
