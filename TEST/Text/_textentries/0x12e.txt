[FarRight][LoadJasper][Right][LoadDerek]
How far to the oasis? This heat[NL]
is killing me in this armor.[A]
[FarRight]Calm down, Derek. I'm used to riding a[NL]
horse everywhere, having to walk[A][NL]
[Left][LoadLux][FarRight]and lead it on is killing my feet.[A]
[Left]Quiet, you two![A]
[FarLeft][LoadPlayer]Calm down, Lux. The wind is blowing at[NL]
us, so our voices won't carry[A][NL]
forwards to our quarry.[A]
[Left]You really have no idea of[NL]
protocol, do you?[A]
[FarLeft]I'm a freelancer, not a soldier.[A]
[FarRight]Hey, [Tact], what is[NL]
Haedric like, anyway?[A]
[FarLeft]What do[Left][ClearFace][FarLeft] you mean?[A]
[FarRight]Well, we've heard the culture there is[NL]
vastly different from Cesaria.[A][CloseSpeech][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
I suppose you could say that. We're not quite[NL]
as organized as you Cesarians, with your[A][NL]
brigades and strict hierarchy. We call our[NL]
leader the Basileus. Basileus Leon was[A][NL]
selected by the last Basileus, but normally,[NL]
the Basileus will hold a tournament to[A][NL]
select the strongest warrior as their[NL]
successor. Haedric itself is mostly ruled[A][NL]
by the Warlords, who often squabble with[NL]
each other, but no other nation on[A][NL]
Avenir has quite the same strong sense[NL]
of nationalism that Haedricians share.[A][NL]
If there's a matter of national importance,[NL]
everyone will follow Basileus Leon into[A][NL]
battle, regardless of past quarrels.[A]
[Right]That seems... Unstable.[NL]
Isn't there fear of civil war?[A]
[MidLeft]Do you all fear the General[NL]
turning on the Emperor?[A]
[Right]I suppose not. Is it really that similar?[A]
[MidLeft]From my experiences, yes.[A]
[FarRight]There were concerns about Captain Maximus'[NL]
predecessor, but he was killed in[A][NL]
battle and Maximus succeeded him. Just[NL]
like if the Captain were to die now,[A][NL]
Vice Captain Lux would succeed him. We[NL]
all trust each other, so long as we[A][NL]
have such a strong leader like[NL]
General Rex leading us.[A]
[MidLeft]I suppose we're all more[NL]
similar than we seem.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveLeft][FarLeft][LoadLux]
Quiet down! We're near the oasis where I[NL]
saw Uzkalis' men before. It looks[A][NL]
like Uzkalis himself isn't there...[NL]
But we might as well strike now.[A]
[Left]Understood. Arc, follow me.[A][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadArc]
I'm right behind you, [Tact].[A][ClearFace][LoadJasper][FarLeft]
Derek, Jasper, go with them. Time to[NL]
prove yourselves, rookies. Luke[A][NL]
and I will head up the back.[A]
[FarRight]Yes, sir![A]
[Right]I'm on it.[A][X]
