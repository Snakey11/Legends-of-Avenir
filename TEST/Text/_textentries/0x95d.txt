[MidRight][LoadLuke][Left][LoadPlayer][FarLeft][LoadArc]Some people...[A][NL]
[MidRight]Calm down Arc, please.[A][NL][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadArya]
[Left]It doesn't matter now. Let's go.[A][NL]
[FarRight]Wait.[A][NL]
[Right][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadLuke][Right]Oh. It's you. You need something?[A][NL]
[FarRight]I want you all to come back[NL]
with me. To Shizon.[A][NL]
[FarLeft]Haha, to that island? Why?[A][NL]
[FarRight]You are honorable people. Good[NL]
fighters. You would be welcome there.[A][NL]
[Left]You've all turned your back on[NL]
the Higher Beings, though.[A][NL]
[FarRight]Please, Luke.[....] You'll understand if you[NL]
just come. Arc, with these bandits dead,[A][NL]
there's nothing left of Gerwick's clan.[A][NL]
[Right]Hold up. My job is guarding the caravan.[NL]
I can't leave that unfinished.[A][NL]
[FarLeft]There's a checkpoint just a few miles down[NL]
the road. We can stop there and[A][NL]
finish this discussion then.[A][NL]
[Right]I'm interested. I want to see the world.[NL]
[Smile]I've always wanted to go, and this may[A][NL]
be my only chance.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadPlayer]
Are you two in?[A][NL]
[FarLeft]There was nothing in Danaan for me anyway.[NL]
[Smile]It's time for me to follow my own path.[A]
[Left]I suppose time away from the mainland to think[NL]
in the wilderness is exactly what I need.[A][NL]
[FarRight][Smile]Excellent. Let's finish your caravan job,[NL]
and then I'll make arrangements[A][NL]
with an old friend...[.....][A][X]
