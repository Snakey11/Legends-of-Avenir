[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadInkeeper]Welcome, traveller![.....][NL]
What brings you here?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I'm a freelancer,[.] looking for work.[....][NL]
I come with a message,[.] however.[A][NL]
Is there a militia in this town,[.][NL]
or even a Haedric Warlord?[A][NL]
[MidRight]Basileus Leon seems to think Danaan is a[NL]
lost cause due to our proximity[A][NL]
to Arcanae.[....] Arc is the closest thing we[NL]
have to a leader over there.[A][NL]
I'd speak with him.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Thank you for the help.[A][ClearFace][MidRight][ClearFace][.......][.......]
[MidLeft][LoadArc][.......][.......][MidRight][LoadPlayer]Arc,[.] is it?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Yeah. I'm the head of the[NL]
militia here.[....] Who are you?[A]
[MidRight]My name is [Tact]. I'm a[NL]
freelancer who just finished a job,[A][NL]
but I was attacked by highwaymen.[....][NL]
I bring concerning news.[A]
[MidLeft]There are all sorts of bandit groups[NL]
and highwaymen around here. We've[A][NL]
wanted to track them down, but we just[NL]
don't have the men to spare to do so.[A][NL]
We all have lives outside of fighting.[NL]
None of us are true Haedric soldiers.[A][NL]
[MidRight]I heard them mention the Gerwick[NL]
Bandits.[....] Have you heard of them?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Aye.[....] Gerwick was a lumberjack here awhile[NL]
ago, but was exiled after he was[A][NL]
found guilty of destroying a[NL]
tree near the Ingefont.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Ingefont?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Are you not familiar with Inge and Vene?[NL]
Inge is energy that gives life to[A][NL]
vegetation and strength to us warrior types.[NL]
It flows from Ingefonts, so we get[A][NL]
worried when people do damage to the[NL]
landscape near them. Vene is the energy[A][NL]
that mages use, but most of us here in[NL]
Danaan don't pay much attention to it.[A][NL]
[MidRight]Interesting.[....] I never realized that[NL]
warriors and mages use different[A][NL]
energy. Back to the matter at hand...[.......][NL]
I heard that the Gerwick bandits[A][NL]
were planning a raid on Danaan.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]Really? Gerwick must be getting cocky.[NL]
Most of his men aren't real fighters,[A][NL]
and not that we are, but the Basileus has[NL]
been coming down hard on any bandits[A][NL]
that start infighting in Haedric.[A][NL]
[MidRight]What do you have in the way of men?[NL]
Could I be of assistance?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]We're a small militia, but-[A][NL][MidRight][MoveRight]
[Pause]
[FarRight][LoadMilitiaMan]Arc! Gerwick and his bandits are here,[NL]
and they're about to raid the village![A][NL]
The militia is all scattered![A][NL]
[MidLeft]Damn! I'm heading out now.[A][NL][FarRight][ClearFace]
[Right]I'll come too.[A][NL]
[MidLeft]This is our battle, so stay out of it![NL]
We don't have the money to pay you.[A][NL]
[Right]I don't need the money, but at this[NL]
point my choice is either kill or be[A][NL]
killed. I'd rather do the killing.[A][NL]
[MidLeft] ...[.......] Very well then.[.....] Come on![A][X]
