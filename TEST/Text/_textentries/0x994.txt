Gerwick... Damn. Whoever this[NL]
band's leader is, he's brutal.[A]
[MidRight]Gerwick...[....] Rest in peace.[NL]
You led a troubled life.[A][NL]
I wish we could have helped you.[A][ClearFace][FarLeft][ClearFace][Right][LoadFinoc][FarRight][LoadElanil]
[Left]I'm not convinced this man was the[NL]
leader of the clan. Finoc, Elanil, can[A][NL]
you search for any signs of a group escaping[NL]
or a lower level to this fort?[A]
[Right]I'll fly out to see if any[NL]
group is heading anywhere.[A]
[FarRight]I'll investigate the fort.[NL]
Help your friends bury that bandit.[A]
[Left]I've not known them very long.[NL]
It's better to give them their time.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]I understand. I'll report to you if[NL]
I find something. A group this large must[A][NL]
at least have a treasure hold[NL]
somewhere in their hideout.[A][X]
