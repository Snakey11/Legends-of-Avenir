[FarLeft][LoadKendrick][Right][LoadPlayer][FarRight][LoadArc][Left][LoadArya]We've arrived.[A]
[FarLeft]I hope you all enjoyed your trip.[NL]
I'm gonna restock and then head back.[A]
[Right]Not gonna come with us?[A]
[FarLeft]Sorry, [Tact]. I have[NL]
a strict deal with Xexim.[A]
[FarRight]Farewell, Kendrick![FarLeft][ClearFace][FarRight][NL]
Who is this Xexim fellow, anyway?[A]
[Left]He is the closest thing we have to a leader.[NL]
He upholds the Four Rulings and[A][NL]
also maintains the shrine.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke]Shrine...?[A]
[Left]The central one, anyway. There are many[NL]
shrines dotted around Shizon, all of[A][NL]
which dedicated to the higher beings.[NL]
Some are for angels, some are for[A][NL]
demons. It all really depends. The one[NL]
Xexim maintains is dedicated to[A][NL]
the Angel of Creation.[A]
[Right]So that's why Shizon has a[NL]
tie to the Higher Beings...[A]
[FarLeft][LoadXexim]Indeed. Arya, why have you[NL]
brought these outsiders here?[A][Right][MoveMidRight][Left][MoveRight][ClearFace][LoadArya]
I felt you should meet them.[NL]
They are skilled, and-[A]
[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]You are an assassin, nothing more. We have[NL]
decreed that the only outsiders allowed[A][NL]
are Kendrick and his crew, and anyone we[NL]
agree upon with the Cesarian Emperor.[A][NL]
These people meet neither[NL]
of those requirements.[A]
[MidRight]Xexim. I want to understand[NL]
the truth behind Shizon.[A]
[MidLeft]You are an outsider.[NL]
I have nothing to say to you.[A]
[MidRight]In that case, allow[NL]
me to become an assassin.[A]
[FarRight][Tact], you've gone mad![A]
[ClearFace][LoadArc][Tact], what the hell!?[A]
[MidLeft]Oh...[Smile] You wish to take[NL]
the test, do you...?[A]
[MidRight]I'm up for the challenge. How neat[NL]
would it be if I were one of them?[A][NL]
I feel this will be the best[NL]
way to hone my skills.[A][MidLeft][MoveFarLeft][Right][MoveLeft][ClearFace][LoadArya]
[Tact], the induction test is madness.[NL]
There's no way you can do it.[A]
[MidRight][MoveRight]Please, Arya. You did it, didn't you?[A]
[Left]Well, yes, but...[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadLuke]I will accompany you, [Tact].[NL]
I also want to figure out the truth here.[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadArc]Luke?[....] You're kidding.[A]
[FarRight]I'm curious to see what this 'test' is,[NL]
and perhaps I can gain some sort of[A][NL]
enlightenment from this experience.[NL]
It also seems that we're not leaving[A][NL]
any time soon.[.....] Are you with us, Arc?[A]
[FarLeft][Smile]Hmm... I'll go with ya. Why not?[A]
[Right][Smile]Luke... Arc...[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadXexim]You all may accompany him, if you so[NL]
desire. Arya will be your guide.[A]
[Left]It would be my honor.[A]
[FarLeft]I will warn you that the test is designed[NL]
to be a challenge. It will not be[A][NL]
easy. Are you ready?[A]
[Right]Yes, I am ready.[A]
[FarLeft]Let's go.[A][X]
