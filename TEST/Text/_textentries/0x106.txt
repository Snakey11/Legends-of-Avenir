Visitors from Altia? What[NL]
business do you have here?[A][CloseSpeech][Left][MoveRight]
I'm Corporal Elanil of the Altian Military.[NL][Left][LoadPlayer][Right]
This is [Tact] and Luke from Haedric.[A]
[FarRight]An Altian soldier, a monk, and a[NL]
mercenary. An interesting bunch.[A][NL]
What brings you to our hamlet?[A]
[Left]I am currently serving as a commander of[NL]
the New Arcanian Military. We have aligned[A][NL]
ourselves with Altia. We have no intention[NL]
of dragging you into this war, we[A][NL]
simply ask for safe passage for our[NL]
squadrons as we come through the[A][NL]
pass to assemble on the plains.[A]
[FarRight]The war... If only us being[NL]
dragged in could be avoided...[A]
[FarLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[FarRight]Border towns never fare well in wartime.[NL]
Only if they have a strong group defending[A][NL]
them, like Bacrun. We have nothing. I wanted[NL]
to believe Altia would retain their[A][NL]
neutrality and that help wasn't needed...[A]
[FarLeft]You have no reason to be dragged into[NL]
the war. We will leave your town be. We have[A][NL]
our own rations and supplies. We require[NL]
nothing but your approval of our passage.[A]
[Pause]
[FarRight]I cannot provide that. I was approached[NL]
not two days ago by a Cesarian Captain...[A][NL]
Captain Maximus. He's a good man. He told us[NL]
to keep our eyes out, and stationed a[A][NL]
battalion here. I am sorry friends. You[NL]
seem to have walked right into his trap.[A]
[Left]Dammit. We were too late. We have[NL][FarRight][ClearFace][Left]
to get back to Arc and the others![A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadElanil]Hurry, before we're cut off![A]
[FarLeft]Why must we fight!?[A]
[Right]Your pacifism will only[NL]
get you killed! Move![A][X]
