Damn, Gerwick is more clever than[NL]
I would have expected...[A]
[Left]How so?[A]
[MidRight]These tracks...[....] They're trying to lead[NL]
us off in opposite directions.[A][NL]
Occasionally, whole groups of footprints[NL]
will split off from the main force...[A]
[FarLeft]How can you tell which[NL]
group is the main force?[A]
[MidRight]The footprints that led at the beginning,[NL]
likely Gerwick's, stay with the main group.[A]
[FarLeft]You can tell that much?[A]
[MidRight]Only because the ground is muddy.[NL]
If it was the dry season,[A][NL]
we'd have bigger issues.[A]
[Left]I think I hear something up ahead.[NL]
There's an old fort nearby...[A][NL]
Think that's where they're headed?[A]
[FarLeft]You mean the one on the edge of Draterus?[NL]
Why would anybody live so close to the[A][NL]
desert? The Wanderers aren't[NL]
exactly hospitable.[A]
[MidRight]But the bandits aren't in the desert.[NL]
The Wanderers have no qualms with them.[A][NL]
But most people would be too nervous to go[NL]
there. It's very intelligent, actually.[A]
[Left]Aye. [Tact] is right. Where are[NL]
we exactly right now? We could try to[A][NL]
get reinforcements from a Warlord or[NL]
nearby militia before moving in...[A]
[MidRight]Doubtful. We're too close to the border[NL]
with Altia at this point. This is more[A][NL]
uninhabited land than anything else.[A]
[Left]So it's just us, eh? We've got 'em[NL]
cornered. Nowhere to run.[A][NL]
I say we head in now.[A]
[MidRight]I agree.[A]
[FarLeft]Is fighting really necessary?[A]
[Left]You know Gerwick like I do Luke.[NL]
What do you think?[A]
[FarLeft]Arc... You're right. Let's go.[A][X]
