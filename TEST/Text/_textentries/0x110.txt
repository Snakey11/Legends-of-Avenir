[Right][LoadPlayer]
I'm surprised at the lack of resistance.[NL]
I'd figure that Cesaria would opperate...[....][A][NL]
a little more...[.] competently...[....][A]
[FarLeft][LoadZalius]Lack of what, you say?[A]
[FarRight][LoadFinoc][Tact]! Get back![A]
[Right][MoveLeft]Who are you?[A]
[FarLeft]That doesn't matter. We are enemies.[A]
[Right][LoadHelmer]Captain Zalius of the Cheetah Brigade.[A]
[FarLeft]Helmer? Lieutenant Helmer, former[NL]
Vice-Captain of the Puma Brigade?[A][NL]
[Smile]Well isn't this a surprise.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadVal]Helmer? What is he saying?[A]
[Right]Before I came to Arcanae, I was a Lieutenant[NL]
under Captain Haderius of the Puma[A][NL]
Brigade. In the war ten years ago, the[NL]
Puma Brigade was obliterated, used[A][NL]
by the former general as fodder.[NL]
So I threw my lot in with Arcanae.[A]
[FarRight]Ten years ago... How did I not know?[A]
[Right]I didn't want anyone to. Simple as that.[A]
[FarRight]Helmer...[A]
[Right]Val, you had your own things you had on your[NL]
mind when we met. It was unimportant. Now's[A][NL]
not the time to have questions.[NL]
The enemy is in front of us.[A]
[FarLeft]Did you not swear an oath, [Smile]Lieutenant?[A]
[Right]It's Corporal. I'm no Cesarian.[A]
[FarLeft]If that's what you earnestly wish to believe.[NL]
General Rex and I look forward to our dance[A][NL][Smile]
together, friends. Good luck facing the top[NL]
knights of the Cesarian military![A][X]
