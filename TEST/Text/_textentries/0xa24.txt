[MidLeft][LoadPlayer][MidRight][LoadAdlez]
Hey, [Tact].[A]
[MidLeft]You had something you[NL]
wanted to tell me?[A]
[MidRight]To be honest, [Tact]... I went into[NL]
this with full knowledge of the futility[A][NL]
of it. There's no way we can stand up[NL]
to both armies at once.[A]
[MidLeft]I agree... Do you think Leon sees it?[A]
[MidRight]I would guess as much. I think all of us do.[NL]
There's still a chance to make a difference.[A]
[MidLeft]What do you mean?[A]
[MidRight][ToggleRed]Whether we fall or not does not matter,[ToggleRed] but[NL]
if you can manage to talk to both enemy[A][NL]
commanders before you fall... Our legacy[NL]
might live on, even though we don't.[A]
[MidLeft]I understand. Adlez,[Smile] it's been an[NL]
honor and a pleasure knowing you.[A]
[MidRight][Smile]Likewise. Godspeed, my friend.[A][X]
