Gerwick... Damn. Whoever this[NL]
band's leader is, he's brutal.[A]
[MidRight]Gerwick...[....] Rest in peace.[NL]
You led a troubled life.[A][NL]
I wish we could have helped you.[A][CloseSpeech][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadFinoc]
[Left]You two! [Smile]Thank you for the[NL]
help. My name's [Tact].[A][FarLeft][ClearFace]
[Right][MoveFarRight][ClearFace][Right]
It was our pleasure. This group has been[NL]
plaguing Altia for months, we were[A][NL]
dispatched by High Priest Izuk to deal[NL]
with them. I am Sergeant Finoc of[A][NL]
the Altian Wyvern Riders.[A]
[FarRight][LoadElanil]I'm Corporal Elanil, archery division.[NL]
We appreciate your assistance as well.[A]
[Left]I'm not convinced this man was the[NL]
leader of the clan. Finoc, Elanil, can[A][NL]
you search for any signs of a group escaping[NL]
or a lower level to this fort?[A]
[Right]I'll fly out to see if any[NL]
group is heading anywhere.[A]
[FarRight]I'll investigate the fort.[NL]
Help your friends bury that bandit.[A]
[Right][Smile]I've not known them very long.[NL]
It's better to give them their time.[A]
[FarRight][Smile]I understand. I'll report to you if[NL]
I find something. A group this large must[A][NL]
at least have a treasure hold[NL]
somewhere in their hideout.[A][X]
