There is another force coming... Is that...[NL]
Efil? If he's here... This does not bode[A][NL]
well. It looks as though they're engaging[NL]
the Cesarians... If Efil had been able to[A][NL]
convince Maximus to negotiate, I would have[NL]
considered it. But it looks as though today[A][NL]
is the day the Hero Efil falls... Soldiers![NL]
Strike the new foe when attacked! They are[NL]
naive to think negotiation is possible, and[A][NL]
must be eradicated like any other that[NL]
stands in the way of us and our goal![A][X]
