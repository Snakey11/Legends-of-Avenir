These Nightmare Modules have been ported from their Blazing Sword counterparts in order to expand upon the functionality of Nightmare for Sacred Stones.

A Class Editor Module is included here, as the original Terrain Type editor pointed to the avoid and defence given by terrain in the wrong order. 
Copy the Class editor module and the Terrain Bonus Type file over wherever you have them installed.


Feel free to rehost and modify these files as long as credit is given to the creators.
