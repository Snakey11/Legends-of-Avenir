# 0x0615
Some weapons are especially[.][NL]

These weapons will cause heavy[NL]
damage to those units. For[NL]
example, bows are particularly[NL]
effective against flying units.[.][NL]
The weapon icons in the combat[NL]
information window will glow[NL]
when your unit is facing an[.][NL]
enemy that is weak against[NL]
that weapon.[X]

# 0x0616
Critical hits inflict three times[.][NL]
the normal damage to enemies.[.][NL]
Your chance of a critical strike[NL]
changes depending on your unit's[NL]
attributes and the weapon with[NL]
which you are attacking.[X]

# 0x0617
Any attack from a weapon is a[.][NL]
physical attack. Each unit's[NL]
DEF (defense) attribute[.][NL]

against physical attacks. The[.][NL]
higher the number, the less[.][NL]
damage he takes. Knights and[NL]
mercenaries have good defense.[X]

# 0x0618
Any attack with magic is called[.][NL]
a magical attack. Your unit's[.][NL]
RES (resistance) attribute[NL]
shows how well he defends[.][NL]
against them. The higher the[NL]
number, the less damage he[NL]
takes. Mages, monks, clerics[NL]
& shamans have high resistance.[.][X]

# 0x0619
Restore HP to your units by using[.][NL]
vulneraries, elixirs, and staves.[.][NL]

Any unit can rescue a blue or[.][NL]
green unit in an adjacent tile.[.][NL]
However, your constitution must[.][NL]
be higher than that of the unit[.][NL]
you're trying to rescue.[NL]
The rescuing unit suffers a[.][NL]
penalty in speed and skill,[.][NL]
but the rescued unit is[.][NL]
protected from attacks.[.][NL]
If a unit is about to lose all[NL]
of its HP, use the rescue[.][NL]
command to whisk it to safety.[X]

# 0x061E

any adjacent tile. The dropped[NL]
unit will not be able to move[.][NL]

inventory and press the A Button[NL]
to receive that item.[.][X]

# 0x0622
Items have a limited number of[NL]
uses. Each time you use an item[.][NL]
its durability goes down. The[.][NL]
number next to an item indicates[NL]
how many times it can be used.[NL]
When that number reaches 0, the[.][NL]
item breaks and disappears.[.][NL]
Be careful not to let items drop[NL]
to 0 in the heat of battle.[.][X]

# 0x0623
A supply convoy travels with[NL]
your main character. If you[.][NL]
move to a space adjacent your[.][NL]

these spaces.[.][X]

# 0x0627

Move a unit to a house to visit[.][NL]
the occupants of that house.[NL]

useful information that might[.][NL]
turn the battle in your favor.[NL]
Visit houses whenever you get[.][NL]
the opportunity.[X]

# 0x0629
Move a unit to a village to[.][NL]

Use thieves, torches, and[.][NL]
Torch staves to increase your[.][NL]
field of vision.[X]

# 0x062E
These siege weapons[.][NL]
fire missiles from long[.][NL]
distances. Place an archer or[.][NL]
sniper on them to use them.[.][X]

# 0x062F
On your quest, you will run[.][NL]
across many characters who[NL]
might join your cause. Watch[NL]
story hints carefully to find[.][NL]
who should talk to these[NL]
characters and convince them[NL]
to join you.[X]

# 0x0630
Except in rare cases, if one of[.][NL]
your units loses all of its HP,[.][NL]
it will retreat from battle and be[NL]
unable to fight again. Be careful![X]

# 0x0631
Some units have special bonds[.][NL]
between them. The longer they[.][NL]
spend in adjoining spaces, the[NL]
stronger that bond will grow.[.][NL]
Once this bond is strong enough,[NL]
the Support command will appear[.][NL]
on the command menu.[NL]
Select it to make the characters[NL]
share a support conversation.[.][X]

the better the bonuses received.[NL]
Support levels increase each[NL]
time units share a conversation.[X]

# 0x0633

unit to join you.[.][X]

character you think might know[NL]
that enemy unit into a space[NL]
adjacent to it to see if they[.][NL]
can talk.[.][NL]
Be careful! Enemy units will[NL]
continue to attack until you[NL]
talk to them! Try not to take[.][NL]
them out or be taken out before[.][NL]
you have a chance to chat.[X]

# 0x0635

and paintings, and her popularity soared.[.][X]

Tana, Winged Queen[X]

# 0x0816
Tana lived happily in the prosperous post-[NL]
war Frelia. She flew to Renais often to[.][NL]
visit her dear friend Eirika.[.][X]

# 0x0817
Busy days awaited Eirika and Ephraim as they[NL]
struggled to rebuild Renais. Their work gave[NL]
new hope to those ravaged by the war, and[.][NL]
with Eirika's constant help, Ephraim grew to[NL]
be a trusted and honorable king.[X]

# 0x0818
Upon their return to Renais, Eirika and Seth[NL]
were wed, with the blessings of Ephraim and all[.][NL]
of the Knights of Renais. The tale of the love[NL]
that grew between a princess and her loyal[NL]
knight became a beloved romance in Renais.[X]

# 0x0819
After the war, Eirika and Saleh returned to their[.][NL]
respective homes. Eirika visited Caer Pelyn[.][NL]
when she could. Eventually, she left Renais in[NL]
the care of her brother and wed Saleh. Their[NL]
daughter resembles the legendary Nada Kuya.[.][X]

# 0x081A
Following the war, Tana and Eirika remained[.][NL]
the best of friends. They visited one another[.][NL]
when time permitted, and as they grew older,[NL]
their children shared a bond of friendship[NL]
as close as Eirika and Tana themselves did.[.][X]

# 0x081B
After the war, Eirika and Forde returned to[.][NL]
Renais. Eirika spent her days toiling in[NL]
the reconstruction of Renais, and he was her[NL]
faithful supporter. His portrait of Eirika[NL]
captured the smile he had thought lost forever.[.][X]

# 0x081C
After the war, Ephraim returned to Renais and[.][NL]
Myrrh to Darkling Woods. They both turned their[.][NL]
attention to their respective duties but never[NL]
forgot one another. Though Myrrh never again[NL]
left Darkling Woods, Ephraim often visited her.[.][X]

# 0x081D
Ephraim and L'Arachel each returned home[NL]
after the war, but L'Arachel visited Renais[.][NL]
often. Over time, the two were wed. Their[.][NL]
marriage threw Rausten into turmoil, but[NL]
L'Arachel's self-centeredness carried the day.[X]

# 0x081E
Once Renais was stable again, Ephraim and[.][NL]
Tana were wed. Innes protested vocally, but[.][NL]
when he saw how happy Tana was, he gave the[.][NL]
marriage his blessings. Renais and Frelia[.][NL]
are now bound by blood as well as friendship.[.][X]

# 0x081F
Natasha returned to Renais with Seth, where[.][NL]
the two were wed. The reconstruction of Renais[NL]
kept them busy, but when all the work was[.][NL]
done, they settled down to live their days[NL]
in peace and happiness.[.][X]

# 0x0820
Franz brought Amelia home with him to Renais.[.][NL]
Amelia spent a short time in Renais's army,[.][NL]
but once she and Franz were married, she[NL]
retired her commission. The two had a daughter[NL]
who grew to be a great knight herself.[X]

# 0x0821
Gilliam and Syrene returned to Frelia, where they[.][NL]
were married. All agreed they were a perfect[NL]
match, and their union was blessed by the[.][NL]
crown and the order of knights. The two[.][NL]
continued their unwavering service together.[X]

# 0x0822
At Innes's request, Vanessa moved into[NL]
Castle Frelia where she continued her duties[NL]
as a knight of the realm. Thereafter, they[NL]
had a child and lived happily with the[NL]
blessing of all around them.[X]

# 0x0823
Forde's love for Vanessa grew after the war,[NL]
and although she loved him as well, she[.][NL]
placed her duty to Frelia first. Undeterred,[NL]
Forde moved to Frelia himself. Over time,[.][NL]
the two were wed.[.][X]

# 0x0824
Father and son returned to Ide, where they[NL]
toiled together to rebuild their village.[.][NL]
Ross grew to become a greater warrior than[NL]
even his father. When he himself had a son,[.][NL]
that child continued his family's legacy.[.][X]

# 0x0825
The childhood friends became lovers first,[NL]
then husband and wife. Worried for Neimi's[NL]
well-being, Colm gave up his adventurer's ways.[.][NL]
Neimi passed on her grandfather's skill in[NL]
archery to her own son and daughter.[X]

# 0x0826
Artur and Lute were married upon their return.[NL]
Artur handled the housework, but otherwise,[.][NL]
their lives were unchanged. When they had a[.][NL]
son, Lute's interests shifted from studying[.][NL]
Artur to studying her son's baffling habits.[X]

# 0x0827
After the war, Kyle and Lute were married in[NL]
Renais. Kyle's friends were disturbed by his[NL]
choice of brides, but they could not deny[.][NL]
his happiness. Before long, they had a son,[.][NL]
and Kyle dedicated himself to his upbringing.[.][X]

# 0x0828
When Joshua returned to Jehanna, he took[NL]
Natasha as his bride and claimed the throne[.][NL]
as its rightful heir. Natasha was the perfect[.][NL]
companion, and together, they carried the[.][NL]
mighty desert nation to great glory.[X]

# 0x0829
Sometimes, the greatest friends also differ[.][NL]
greatly in personality. When Kyle and Forde[.][NL]
returned home, they were celebrated in song[.][NL]
and story. They lived their days in happiness,[NL]
as dearest friends and toughest rivals.[.][X]

# 0x082A
Cormag returned to Grado to assist in the[.][NL]
reconstruction of his country. Shortly[NL]
after, he left to wander on his own. Tana[.][NL]
spent years looking for him. In time, she[.][NL]
found him and knighted him in Frelia's service.[.][X]

# 0x082B
Stories tell of the sparks that flew between[NL]
L'Arachel and Innes when they first met. As[.][NL]
the love between them flourished, so too did[NL]
the bond that united their two nations.[.][X]

# 0x082C
Gerik and Tethys remained bound to no nation[NL]
and beholden to no authority. They bought[.][NL]
themselves a leisurely retirement. Gerik[NL]
taught fencing to city youths, and Tethys[.][NL]
found many stages on which to dance.[X]

# 0x082D
Gerik remained a mercenary, and Marisa[NL]
became his company's fencing instructor.[NL]
Gerik returned the affection she gave[.][NL]
him, although he was troubled to learn she[NL]
was clumsy at everything but fighting.[X]

# 0x082E
Myrrh returned to Darkling Woods, but at[NL]
Saleh's request, she eventually moved to Caer[.][NL]
Pelyn. In time, the townsfolk learned to[NL]
treat her not as the Great Dragon but[.][NL]
rather as a normal girl, and she was happy.[.][X]

# 0x082F
Master and student returned to Caer Pelyn to[NL]
study in peace. Ewan worked hard, and in time,[NL]
his power grew to rival Saleh's. As equals,[.][NL]
the two continued their studies together and[NL]
expanded their knowledge ever more.[.][X]

# 0x0830
Joshua returned to Jehanna with Marisa, where[.][NL]
she pledged service to the crown and became[.][NL]
the top swordfighter in the land. Joshua still[NL]
loved games of chance, but when it came to[NL]
Marisa, she was ever the winner.[X]

# 0x0831
L'Arachel was, in time, made queen of Rausten,[NL]
with Dozla at her side, as always. Later, Dozla[.][NL]
wept like a baby when L'Arachel was wed. His[NL]
emotional outburst is remembered as much as,[NL]
if not more than, the ceremony itself.[X]

# 0x0832
Amelia traveled to Ross's hometown, where she[.][NL]
decided to remain. Over time, the two fell in[.][NL]
love and were wed. Years later they had a son[.][NL]
who grew into a warrior. As he grew in skill[NL]
and strength, he surpassed even his father.[.][X]

# 0x0833
After the war, Ewan and Amelia set out, as[NL]
promised, on a trip around the world. Their[.][NL]
deeds along the way made small legends in the[.][NL]
regions they visited. In time, Amelia gave[NL]
birth to a daughter, and they settled down.[.][X]

# 0x0834
After the war, Joshua challenged Gerik to a[.][NL]
duel in hopes of pressing him to move to[NL]
Jehanna. The match ended in a tie, but Gerik[NL]
was impressed by Joshua's swagger. From that[NL]
day forward, Gerik never left Joshua's side.[X]

# 0x0835
Sisters Syrene and Vanessa returned to Frelia[.][NL]

Together, they renewed their bond as siblings[.][NL]
and vowed never to let that bond fail.[X]

# 0x0836
After the reconstruction of Renais, Innes[.][NL]

The continent of Magvel.[A][NL]
For some 800 years, a quiet peace reigned in [.][NL]
the absence of the terrible darkness.[.][A][NL]
The Sacred Stones have been passed from [NL]
generation to generation.[.][A][NL]
Nations have been built around their power [.][NL]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Renais, ruled by Fado, [NL]

[LoadOverworldFaces]In these times of peace, tales of past[NL]

and memories of the ancient dark arts[.][NL]
have all but evaporated.[A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It is now the year 803...[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In an instant, the whole of Magvel is [NL]
threatened by an unexpected atrocity.[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Grado Empire, the largest of the [.][NL]
Sacred Stone nations,[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]has invaded the kingdom of Renais under [NL]
orders from Emperor Vigarde.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A longtime ally of Grado, Renais is caught[NL]
off guard, unable to mount any resistance.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's forces move quickly, seizing one[NL]
territory after another.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Compounding King Fado's worries, his son,[.][NL]
Prince Ephraim, has gone missing.[.][A][0x02][NL]

Eirika should do [.][ToggleRed]7[.][ToggleRed] points,[NL]
and the enemy should do [ToggleRed]9[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
You see the [ToggleRed]x2[ToggleRed] next to[NL]
[ToggleRed]Mt[ToggleRed], right?[A][NL]
This indicates that you will[NL]
[ToggleRed]attack twice[ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
Eirika is faster than her[.][NL]
opponent, so she can [.][ToggleRed]strike[NL]
twice[.][ToggleRed] in one turn.[.][A][NL]

[ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] is the likelihood that[.][NL]
you will land your blow.[A][NL]
Eirika's [.][ToggleRed]Hit[.][ToggleRed] is 94, so she[NL]

[ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed], short for Critical, also[NL]
appears in this window.[.][A][NL]
This is the chance an attack[NL]

Well, then take us with you.[A][NL]
I'm a handy guy to have around.[.][NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x04][0x01][OpenMidRight]I retrieved your bracelet from[NL]
the bandits' stronghold.[A][NL]
Here you are, Princess.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Seth.[A][NL]
You know[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Father gave me this[.][NL]
bracelet when I was a child.[A][NL]
It has only one match in the[NL]
world, and my brother wears it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Lady Eirika, you must take care never to[NL]
lose that bracelet.[.][A][NL]
It is the proof that King Fado entrusted[NL]
the future of Renais to you, his children.[A][OpenMidLeft]Seth[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What is it you're[.][NL]
not telling me?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I apologize, Your Highness.[.][A][NL]
When the time comes, I will tell[NL]
you what I know. Until then, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I see.[A][NL]
If you tell me it must wait,[NL]
then it can wait. I trust you.[A][OpenMidRight]Then we should get moving again.[A][NL]
We're safe from bandits for now,[NL]
but I can't guarantee for how long.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]This is just the beginning,[.][NL]
isn't it?[.][A][NL]
If we hope to free our homeland, it[.][NL]
will take battle after battle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm afraid so, Your Highness.[.][A][NL]
The day you and Prince Ephraim win back[.][NL]
the freedom and honor of Renais will come.[A][NL]
But I fear it lies at the end of a long[.][NL]

In the names of all those I could[.][NL]
not save, I'll lead us home.[A][NL]
Let's go. My brother awaits![A][X]

no orders.[A][NL]
Perhaps, just this once, I should[.][NL]
take the lead[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]What could His Majesty be thinking?[.][A][NL]
Breaking our long-held alliance with[NL]
Renais[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]invading without warning[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
He's never been this way before. He[.][NL]
abhors violence.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]And have you noticed the recent[.][NL]
promotions? Who are they going to?[A][NL]
Certainly not to the soldiers who[.][NL]
have Grado's best interests at heart.[.][A][NL]
I fear this invasion is the prelude[.][NL]
to a much larger war.[.][A][NL]
I feel as though His Majesty is no[NL]
longer the man we knew him to be.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Glen, it doesn't matter what any[NL]
of us might think of our orders.[A][NL]
We are his servants, and we will not[NL]
question His Majesty's intentions.[A][OpenLeft]I know that, Selena.[NL]
And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]That's enough. Both of you.[.][NL]

[ToggleRed]Walls[.][ToggleRed] with cracks in them can be[.][NL]
attacked and destroyed.[.][A][NL]
Once a wall is destroyed, you can pass[NL]
through the opening you've created.[.][A][NL]
When your way seems blocked, be sure[NL]
to check all the [.][ToggleRed]walls[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][X]

# 0x099C
The bandits' [.][ToggleRed]hand axes[.][ToggleRed] can be used[NL]
in both [ToggleRed]direct[ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]indirect combat[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
They can be wielded like normal axes[NL]
in direct, hand-to-hand combat[A][NL]
or thrown to strike enemies who are[.][NL]
a space away or at an angle to you.[.][A][NL]
Like bows, they can also hit enemies[NL]
on the [.][ToggleRed]other sides of walls[ToggleRed].[.][A][X]

The [ToggleRed]thief[.][ToggleRed] Colm has appeared.[.][A][NL]

Place the cursor on a unit and press[NL]
the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to display that[NL]
unit's [.][ToggleRed]status[ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
For example, if you select a bandit[.][NL]
and press the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed], you'll[NL]
see that he's carrying a hand axe.[A][0x02][NL]
If you press the [.][ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] again,[.][NL]

item on-screen.[.][A][NL]
You can use the [ToggleRed]R Button[ToggleRed] to see[.][NL]

Bows are [.][ToggleRed]ranged weapons[ToggleRed].[.][NL]

may decide to join you.[.][A][X]

# 0x09A1
Colm and Neimi have an [.][ToggleRed]invisible[.][NL]
bond[ToggleRed] that ties them together.[.][A][NL]
Units that have such a bond can[.][NL]
develop a [ToggleRed]support relationship[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][NL]
Units become closer and their bond[NL]
stronger the longer they are[NL]
[ToggleRed]adjacent to one another[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
Eventually, they will be able to[NL]
share a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][NL]
Units that share a support relationship[.][NL]
fight with [.][ToggleRed]improved abilities[ToggleRed][NL]
when they are near each other.[A][0x02][NL]
There are three levels of support[.][NL]
units can share: [.][ToggleRed]C, B, and A[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
Levels are gained by staying[NL]
side-by-side as much as possible.[.][A][0x02][NL]
Colm and Neimi are not the only units[.][NL]
that can have support relationships.[NL]
Eirika and Seth, among others, can [.][NL]
grow close to other units as well.[A][0x02][NL]
Watch how characters interact with each[.][NL]
other to guess at who might share[.][NL]
a support relationship with whom.[.][A][0x02][NL]
If you have two units you think may[.][NL]
have such a bond, [ToggleRed]place them next[.][NL]
to one another again and again[ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
Who knows: they may eventually share[NL]
a [ToggleRed]support conversation[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][NL]
However, bear in mind that each unit[NL]
can have only [ToggleRed]5[.][ToggleRed] support relationships.[.][A][X]

axes earlier, try looking at enemy items[NL]

chapter 2, section 7, paragraph 8.[A][OpenMidRight]You know of them?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Duh! I'm a prodigy. I can recall[NL]
most everything I see or hear.[A][NL]

Sounds painful, wouldn't you say?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, er, well[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Be that as it may, I[NL]

You should stay here within the[.][NL]
safety of the village.[A][OpenMidLeft]Very well. I don't mind staying here.[.][NL]
In fact, it seems the smarter choice.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]Magic is far more powerful than any[.][NL]
monster's claws.[A][NL]
The thickest hide and strongest armor[.][NL]
are useless against magic's power.[A][NL]
Yes, I suppose I could have studied[.][NL]
swords, but only magic is worthy of me.[.][A][NL]

cover against attacks.[A][NL]

There are three different schools of[NL]
[ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed], each of which is governed[.][NL]
by the [.][ToggleRed]trinity of magic[ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
[ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed].[.][NL]
[ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed].[.][NL]
[ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed] is strong against [.][ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
For now, just remember that [ToggleRed]Light[.][NL]
is strong against Dark[ToggleRed].[.][A][X]

# 0x09B7
The [ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed] that Artur and Lute[NL]
wield cannot be stopped by[NL]
physical [.][ToggleRed]defense[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
However, magic [.][ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed] can affect[.][NL]
the damage it does.[.][A][NL]
So, it's possible to do high damage to[NL]
units like [.][ToggleRed]knights[.][ToggleRed], who possess[.][NL]
strong [.][ToggleRed]defenses[ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
On the other hand, it's difficult to harm[.][NL]
units with high [ToggleRed]resistance[ToggleRed], like[NL]
pegasus knights.[A][NL]
Magic can also be used to attack[NL]
directly or indirectly, like a hand axe.[A][NL]
It can be wielded like a sword to strike[NL]
adjacent foes or like a bow to hit[NL]
enemies at a distance.[A][X]

# 0x09B8
Starting on this map, you'll be able[NL]
to use the [.][ToggleRed]preparations screen[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]

battle and [.][ToggleRed]manage items[ToggleRed] to secure[NL]
the best chance of victory.[.][A][X]

# 0x09B9
Forests and other map areas may[.][NL]
offer [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
Units in forests are harder to hit[NL]
and take less damage when struck.[.][A][NL]
Simply put, staying under trees makes[.][NL]
it more difficult for enemies to hit [.][NL]
and harm you.[.][A][NL]
Areas that have [ToggleRed]terrain bonuses[.][ToggleRed] are[NL]
[ToggleRed]forests[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]mountains[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]fortresses[ToggleRed], and[.][NL]

Sometimes, you can talk to an enemy and[.][NL]
convince him to join you.[.][A][NL]
For example, right now, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] might[NL]
be inclined to talk with [.][ToggleRed]Natasha[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][NL]
However, [.][ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]red unit[ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
Unlike green units you've seen before,[NL]
he will [ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] until he's spoken to.[A][NL]
Moreover, [ToggleRed]Joshua[ToggleRed] is a [ToggleRed]myrmidon[ToggleRed], who[.][NL]
specializes in [.][ToggleRed]critical hits[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][NL]
If you are struck by a [.][ToggleRed]critical hit[ToggleRed], you[.][NL]

It's a good idea to check [ToggleRed]Crit[ToggleRed][NL]

This weapon is similar to rapiers in[NL]

It's Master Valter.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What's the situation, Tirado? You[.][NL]
have captured Ephraim, haven't you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No. Prince Ephraim still fights[.][NL]
in the lands north of Renvall.[A][OpenMidRight]And why is that?[A][NL]
What has happened to all[NL]
those mercenaries you hired?[A][OpenMidLeft]They've proven to be less than adequate.[A][NL]
Ephraim's clever. His band strikes quickly[NL]

We more than double his numbers, and yet[NL]
he uses the terrain wisely to fight us.[.][A][NL]
He has no army[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]just a small force[NL]

Tirado[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Bring him to me as quickly[NL]

We're in enemy territory. I will not[NL]

But eventually, we do need to face[NL]
reality. What are we going to do?[.][A][OpenFarRight]Word of mouth has it that the invasion[NL]

Renvall holds an important place in[.][NL]
Grado's national defense.[.][A][NL]
If we can get the upper hand[NL]

to my father and Eirika.[A][SendToBack][OpenRight]I understand what you're saying, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
can we do it with our current strength?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Every soldier in this area is[.][NL]

The enemy has us vastly outnumbered.[NL]
Attacking the castle is a ridiculous idea.[A][NL]
If the enemy thinks the same[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

Either way, we can't run forever.[.][NL]

He ordered me to keep silent until[NL]

However, with all that has happened,[NL]
with Emperor Vigarde's actions[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I feel it imperative that I tell[NL]
you everything, Princess Eirika.[A][NL]
Are you ready to hear the secret[NL]
of the bracelet you wear?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]As you know, Princess[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Renais houses one of the[NL]
legendary Sacred Stones.[A][OpenMidRight]Of course. It's in the temple. It's[.][NL]
supposed to be a ward against evil.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, the true stone is. But the stone[.][NL]
in the temple is nothing but a forgery.[.][A][NL]
The real Sacred Stone of Renais lies[NL]
beneath the royal castle.[.][A][NL]
Guarding it is a powerful seal, an[NL]
infinitely complex lock of sorts.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A][NL]
Is this true?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. King Fado confided in me himself.[A][NL]
The Sacred Stones banished evil long ago[NL]
and possess powers beyond our ken.[A][NL]
The ancient kings of Renais felt it[.][NL]
prudent to seal ours away.[A][NL]
They feared its power could be misused.[.][NL]
They thought to remove the temptation.[A][NL]
The keys to break the seal were hidden,[.][NL]
too[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Forged into bracelets[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The very ones that you and your[.][NL]

How could Father keep this a[NL]
secret from me for so long?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][0x93]They must know nothing of the bracelets.[.][NL]
Tell them only if some great peril strikes.[0x94][A][NL]
These were King Fado's exact orders.[A][NL]
Prince Ephraim knows nothing of the[.][NL]
bracelets' secret, either.[A][NL]
The king told me this out of fear that[NL]
something might happen to him.[A][NL]
So that, when the time came, the two of you[.][NL]
would learn the truth.[A][OpenMidRight]The bracelets have such meaning[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. And we are the only living souls who[.][NL]
know the secret of the Stone of Renais.[.][A][NL]
At least, that's what I was given to[NL]
believe. And yet[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Yet the Grado army has made it clear[NL]
that they want me only for my bracelet.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, quite clear at that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I don't know how, but Emperor Vigarde[.][NL]
must have learned the secret somehow.[.][A][NL]
And now, his troops pursue the bracelet, and[NL]
we are no closer to knowing his motives.[A][OpenMidRight]He would use the bracelets to unlock the[NL]
Sacred Stone and destroy it in secret[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Perhaps.[A][OpenMidRight]Which means that my brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

bracelet already, and he may be[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Princess, we must take Novala's words to[NL]

We've been held captive here in this[NL]

captors during that time?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Unfortunately, no. Not a word[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Our daily meal was brought to us by[.][NL]

How fares Renais?[.][A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Renais has fallen. King Fado[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
The king is dead.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] My king[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
My apologies, Princess Eirika.[NL]
I have served you poorly[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]You're not to blame, Sir Orson.[.][A][NL]
We must look to the future, not[.][NL]

hopes of acquiring my bracelet.[.][A][NL]
My brother wears this bracelet's[NL]
twin, and he is in danger, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Bracelet?[.][A][NL]
Ah, I remember[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Prince Ephraim[NL]
still wears the bracelet.[.][A][NL]

bracelets to someone else.[A][OpenRight]Perhaps, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Give them to me or to Seth. Let[.][NL]
someone you trust guard them.[.][A][NL]
If the empire desires your bracelet, you[NL]
are in danger as long as you hold it.[.][A][NL]
For your own safety, Your Highness,[.][NL]

please give me your weapons.[A][OpenFarRight]Seth?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you talking about, Seth?[.][A][NL]
Can't you see I'm unarmed? Do you[.][NL]
think they allow prisoners weapons?[.][A][NL]
What kind of injury have you taken[NL]
that you suggest such foolishness?[A][OpenRight]If I am mistaken, then I will give[NL]
you all due apologies.[A][NL]
However, there are questions I have[.][NL]
that I cannot answer. Too many questions.[.][A][0x02][NL]
Why did no enemy reinforcements come from[.][NL]
the castle during our battle outside?[.][A][NL]
Why would you escape your cell and yet[NL]
leave Prince Ephraim in chains?[.][A][NL]
How do you know of the tie between the[NL]
bracelets and the Sacred Stone?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Seth, there is some misunderstanding[NL]
here. I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]And why[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Why do you conceal a blade[NL]

Carcino is a nation divided.[A][NL]
As you know, Carcino has no king but is[.][NL]
ruled by a council.[.][A][NL]
But now the council has broken apart[NL]
into factions mired in discord[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Factions[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
You're saying that the whole of[.][NL]
Carcino has not betrayed Frelia?[A][OpenMidRight]Correct. The moderate factions prefer to[NL]
preserve our alliance with Frelia.[A][NL]
Pablo's faction wishes to endear us to[NL]
Grado, to surrender us to their armies.[.][A][0x02][NL]
Once Pablo realized he couldn't ply us with[.][NL]
bribes, he began to have us assassinated.[.][A][NL]
Those of us who remain have taken refuge[NL]
underground. We oppose him where we can.[A][NL]
If you hadn't shown up, I'm not certain[.][NL]
I would still be breathing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I do recall enemy troops combing this area[NL]
when I arrived[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
They were searching for you, is that it?[A][OpenMidRight]Pablo has usurped rule of the council.[NL]
We had no choice but to hide.[.][A][NL]
Not all of Carcino's council has gone[.][NL]
over to Grado's side, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
You must believe me[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the whole of[NL]
Carcino does not believe as Pablo does.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][OpenFarLeft]Lord Klimt[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I understand the[NL]
hardships you've endured.[.][A][NL]

Carcino is not our foe.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I will depart at once for Frelia to[.][NL]
explain our circumstance to the king.[.][A][NL]
I think it is best if you return to[.][NL]
Frelia as well.[.][A][NL]

commands a vast mercenary force.[A][NL]

This Great Dragon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, the inquisitiveness of youth.[.][A][NL]
Come, lass, listen to my words.[.][A][NL]
The Great Dragon is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a blessing, one[.][NL]
that watches over all mankind.[A][NL]
Why, in days long past, when the[NL]
Demon King appeared[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Demon King? Are you speaking of the[.][NL]
legend of the Sacred Stones?[A][NL]
The hero Grado used the power of the five[.][NL]

its debt to the Great Dragon.[.][A][NL]
To hear the story now, one would think[NL]
humans alone brought about victory.[.][A][NL]
That is a gross mistelling of the tale.[.][A][NL]
Only through the Great Dragon's strength[NL]
could the Demon King be sealed away![A][OpenLeft]The Great Dragon and the Demon King[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Mankind may have forgotten its debt,[NL]
but the Great Dragon never forgets.[.][A][NL]
It watches over the bones of the Demon[NL]
King in Darkling Woods.[.][A][NL]
It keeps the Demon King's dark brood[NL]
from swarming the world of men.[.][A][NL]
The Great Dragon's vigilance alone has[NL]
kept us safe from their blind rage.[.][A][OpenLeft]Is that so? I'm[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm[.][NL]

What does this mean?[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You have seen the effects of the[NL]
omen that has appeared in the south.[A][0x02][NL]
There is an energy there that has[.][NL]
fouled the air and darkened the sky.[A][NL]
The Great Dragon left Darkling Woods and[NL]
went south to investigate.[A][NL]
We of the village wished to protect the[.][NL]
Great Dragon, and so I sent my grandson,[A][NL]
Saleh, along as well.[.][A][NL]
But they became embroiled in battle, and[NL]
the Great Dragon disappeared.[.][A][NL]
Since that time, there's been no sign of[NL]
the Great Dragon either here or abroad.[.][A][NL]
We grew worried and directed Saleh to[.][NL]
look for any trace of the Great Dragon.[.][A][NL]
I am worried that the source of that[NL]
foul energy may be responsible.[.][A][OpenLeft]A foul energy[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

How dare you speak so[.][NL]
of the Great Dragon![A][OpenLeft]I-I'm sorry.[A][OpenRight]But if you've seen the noble Myrrh,[.][NL]
perhaps I can proceed more quickly.[.][A][NL]

the Great Dragon yourself, lass?[A][OpenLeft]Yes. Myrrh was with my brother.[.][A][OpenRight]What?![A][NL]

and rescue the Great Dragon![A][OpenFarRight]Understood. I will[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Oh, where are you off to?[.][A][NL]
If you're going to Grado, the swiftest[NL]

You should keep to the rear where it's[NL]

there are knights riding this way[.][NL]

Its defenses are legendary.[.][A][NL]
It is the jewel of Grado's fortifications,[NL]

Tell me what you see, Seth.[.][NL]
Do we have the power to take it?[A][OpenMidRight]It's a daunting task.[.][A][NL]

both terrain and numbers.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But what about in morale?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you suspect the soldiers[.][NL]

This war is a sudden thing, but Grado[.][NL]
and Renais had long been friendly.[A][NL]
Before these hostilities, our nations were[NL]
allies[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]No, closer even than that.[A][NL]
This is the emperor's war, but the hearts[.][NL]
of the people are not so swift to change.[.][A][0x02][NL]
For example, General Duessel, one of the[NL]
Imperial Three they call Obsidian[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
He was the one who taught me what I[.][NL]

Duessel's sympathies are sure to remain[.][NL]
with Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]and with our cause.[.][A][NL]
He is loyal to Grado, but he has no love[NL]
of war. I'm sure he will speak with me.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And more than that, Prince Lyon[.][NL]
has been my friend for years.[.][A][NL]
He can be timid at times and perhaps[NL]
was unable to oppose his father in this.[A][NL]
But I'm sure he detests this fighting[.][NL]

If we can rush the fort and seize the[.][NL]
throne room, I believe they will surrender.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Optimism here may be deadly.[A][NL]
Still, it's a far better plan than[NL]
challenging the main army face-to-face.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Eirika is on her way to Rausten[.][NL]
to help end this conflict.[A][NL]
We cannot afford to wait here[.][NL]

where is General Duessel?[.][A][OpenMidRight]In the capital. The general's been[NL]

You've grown to be quite[NL]
the impressive commander.[.][A][NL]
I remember what a stubborn young[NL]
lad you were when I taught you.[.][A][OpenLeft]Any skill I have, I owe[.][NL]
to you, Duessel.[A][NL]
I'm curious, why are you being[NL]
pursued by your own troops?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft]Speak to me, Duessel.[.][A][NL]
I want to put an end to this war.[.][A][NL]
I'm sure you feel the same way.[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]As you know, the emperor[NL]
was once a man of compassion.[.][A][NL]
He loathed war, and he worked to[NL]
build peace across all nations.[.][A][NL]
Then[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]one day that all changed.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But why? Why did he change?[.][NL]
What happened?[A][OpenMidRight]I wish I knew.[A][NL]
But if you're looking for a[.][NL]
likely cause, I have one.[.][A][NL]
This all seems to have begun[NL]
when Prince Lyon and the mages[A][NL]
created a strange gemstone they[.][NL]
referred to as the Dark Stone.[A][OpenLeft]The Dark Stone?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's what the clerics and the prince[NL]
called it, at any rate.[.][A][NL]
Now, I'm just a soldier. I don't know[.][NL]
anything about these magic things.[A][NL]
But they said the Dark Stone is more[NL]
powerful even than the Sacred Stones.[.][A][OpenLeft]And the Sacred Stones had the power[.][NL]
to defeat the Demon King.[.][A][NL]

they are[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Ephraim.[A][OpenLeft]What is it, Myrrh?[A][OpenFarLeft]The wave of evil I felt[.][NL]
surging from the capital[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It hungers[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It consumes.[NL]

This power can tarnish the purest[.][NL]
of souls with its corruption.[.][A][OpenLeft]Are you saying this Dark Stone is[.][NL]
responsible for the change in Vigarde?[A][NL]
The timing fits, doesn't it? The[NL]
stone is created, and then[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Duessel, where is the Dark Stone now?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's in the capital, with Prince Lyon.[A][NL]
He's been carrying it with him ever[.][NL]
since the day it was created.[.][A][OpenLeft]Understood. Duessel, I'm going[NL]
to the capital.[.][A][NL]
I must talk to Lyon. Maybe we[.][NL]
can restore the emperor together.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm going with you.[.][A][OpenLeft]But we'll be fighting Grado's[.][NL]

already been branded a traitor.[.][A][NL]

why this had to happen?[.][A][NL]
Dame Selena was a good person.[A][NL]

have to die?[A][NL]

no choice. She had to die.[A][NL]

Ephraim, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

Until recently, I was one of Grado's[NL]

However, I think you will not[.][NL]
thank me once you hear it.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft]It all began one year ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
That was when the emperor died.[.][A][NL]

What are you about?[.][A][NL]
One year ago? That's before Grado's[.][NL]

And I just saw the emperor.[.][NL]
I killed him with my own hands.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]Allow me to continue in the order[.][NL]
in which everything occurred.[.][A][NL]
One year ago, the emperor died of[.][NL]
the illness that had plagued him.[.][A][NL]
Prince Lyon was devastated. He[NL]
fell into an endless despair.[.][A][NL]
He felt unworthy to take the throne,[NL]
unable to rule without his father.[A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]He then began to look for a way to[NL]
overturn his father's demise.[.][A][NL]
He wanted to resurrect him[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]Wait, resurrect him?[A][OpenFarLeft]Yes.[A][NL]
As you know, the Stone of Grado is[NL]
possessed of[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]unique powers.[A][NL]
It was once used to seal away the Demon[.][NL]
King, and it alone held the dark one's soul.[A][NL]
It burned within with the Demon King's[NL]
rage, and we called it the Fire Emblem.[.][A][0x02][NL]
Prince Lyon and a team of mages skilled in[NL]
ancient lore hoped to harness its energies.[.][A][NL]
I remember the joy in Prince Lyon's eyes[NL]
when he spoke of using it to save lives.[A][OpenRight]Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]Prince Lyon told us he intended to use[NL]
the Fire Emblem to restore the emperor.[.][A][NL]
His death had been kept from the public,[NL]
but rumors were beginning to fly.[.][A][NL]
We knew we had to hurry, before the people[NL]
learned the truth of the emperor's death.[.][A][NL]
Prince Lyon dedicated himself to research,[NL]
skipping meals, foregoing sleep[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
And then[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]What happened?[A][OpenFarLeft]I wasn't there, so I did not[NL]

By the time I arrived, the[NL]

so allow me to introduce myself.[A][NL]
I am Ephraim, Eirika's brother and[NL]
crown prince of Renais.[.][A][OpenFarRight]I'm Princess L'Arachel of Rausten.[NL]
The pleasure is mine, of course.[A][OpenLeft]I'll begin by telling you of[NL]
how we've fared in our mission.[.][A][NL]
We seized the Grado capital and[.][NL]
defeated her emperor, Vigarde.[A][NL]
Grado's capital guard have, to a man,[.][NL]
surrendered and laid down their arms.[.][A][NL]
Pockets of resistance remain, but the[.][NL]
war itself is over.[.][A][OpenRight]Is that so?[.][A][OpenLeft]However, something remains that[.][NL]
still bothers me.[.][A][NL]
A Grado man named Knoll told me about[.][NL]
something called a [0x93]Dark Stone.[0x94][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft]Their mages had uncovered lore that led[.][NL]
them to craft a powerful magic stone.[.][A][NL]
This Dark Stone may have been the[.][NL]
catalyst of Grado's transformation.[.][A][NL]
It seems to be the source of that black[.][NL]
wave of energy Myrrh described.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft]Vigarde died some time ago, but the power[.][NL]
of the stone played him like a puppet.[A][NL]
The war and everything that passed since[NL]
was planned by the Dark Stone's master.[.][A][OpenRight]Well? Who is it?[A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I still can't believe it,[.][NL]
but I'll tell you nonetheless.[A][NL]
According to Knoll, the man behind[NL]
this is Lyon, the imperial prince.[A][NL]
He said Lyon's got the Dark Stone.[A][OpenRight]Figures it's Prince Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]No, that doesn't make any sense.[A][NL]
Ephraim and I know Lyon better than[.][NL]
that. We've been friends for years.[.][A][NL]
Lyon's not the sort of person who[.][NL]
could start a war like this.[A][OpenRight]But, Eirika[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarLeft]I saw Lyon recently.[A][NL]
Ephraim, you might know this, but after[.][NL]
I abandoned the sea route to Rausten,[.][A][NL]
I traveled overland with Prince[.][NL]
Innes to Jehanna.[.][A][NL]
We ran into trouble with Grado's[NL]
forces, and I chanced upon Lyon.[A][NL]
He didn't share the details of his[NL]
situation, but he intimated that[A][NL]
he was on our side. Despite all[.][NL]
appearances, he was on our side.[A][NL]
So Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Eirika,[.][NL]
I also met Lyon.[A][OpenFarLeft]Did you really?[.][A][OpenLeft]Yes. But, he was like a[.][NL]
completely different person.[A][NL]
To be honest, he didn't seem[NL]
to be completely[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]human.[A][OpenFarLeft]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
What are you saying?[A][OpenLeft]I'll tell you what I saw.[.][A][NL]
I found Lyon inside Grado Keep.[.][A][NL]
This is what he told me:[NL]
He said he was behind this war.[.][A][NL]
He said he'd befriended us solely so that,[NL]
one day, he could invade Renais[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
He told me he killed our father.[A][OpenFarLeft]That[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That can't[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]I know. I can't believe it either.[NL]
I refuse to believe it.[.][A][NL]
How could he have planned all[.][NL]
this since he was a child[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I simply can't fathom it.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][X]

# 0x0B2A
[OpenLeft]I've heard Lyon changed when he acquired[NL]
the Dark Stone.[.][A][NL]
I've no interest in magic, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
There was something uncanny about him.[A][NL]
It seemed almost as though he were being[NL]
controlled by something himself.[A][OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenRight]The two of you might find this hard[.][NL]
to accept, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
The state of Prince Lyon's heart matters[NL]
little. He has the Dark Stone.[A][NL]
That rock is the cause of all that's[NL]
happened. The prince must be stopped.[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenFarRight]Not yet. There is something[.][NL]
that needs doing first.[.][A][OpenFarLeft]L'Arachel?[A][OpenFarRight]Prince Ephraim, I do believe you[NL]
felt it as well.[A][NL]
The Dark Stone held by Prince Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
It exudes a malefic miasma[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
We might be able to handle Prince Lyon[NL]
alone, but that stone is beyond our ken.[A][OpenFarLeft]Then what do you suggest?[.][A][OpenFarRight]The Sacred Stones.[A][OpenFarLeft]The Sacred Stones?[A][OpenFarRight]We've all heard the legend of the[.][NL]
five Sacred Stones.[.][A][NL]
They alone possessed the power to[.][NL]
seal the Demon King away forever.[.][A][NL]
So, of course, to dispel demonic[NL]
magic, we must use the Sacred Stones![.][A][OpenRight]You expect us to pin the outcome[NL]
of this war on some fool legend?[A][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Not just the legend.[NL]
We also have hope.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenLeft]According to Lyon,[A][NL]
he has already seen to the destruction of[.][NL]
Grado's, Frelia's, and Jehanna's stones.[A][OpenFarLeft]Hm. That explains something[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Grado forces attacked me, intent on[.][NL]
destroying the Stone of Renais.[.][A][NL]
If that could be the reason they[NL]
chose to invade Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
The power of the Sacred Stones may[NL]
be greater than we'd ever known.[A][OpenFarRight]Yes, exactly![.][A][NL]

need for you to exhaust yourself.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Understood.[.][A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x22][0x01][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
May I ask your advice?[A][OpenMidRight]What is it, Eirika?[.][NL]
There's no need to be so formal.[A][OpenMidLeft]It's about Lyon[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][0x02][NL]
My brother was right. Lyon's been[.][NL]
possessed by the Demon King.[A][NL]
He[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]He's no longer the Lyon[.][NL]
I once knew.[A][NL]
But I can't help feeling[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]there[.][NL]
must be some way to bring him back.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Please help me, L'Arachel.[NL]
I want to save him.[.][A][NL]
Rausten is the spiritual heart of[.][NL]
Magvel. They keep the ancient lore.[.][A][NL]
You're their princess. You must know[NL]
something about the demons of legend.[.][A][NL]
Is there anything that can save Lyon?[.][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry, Eirika.[.][A][NL]
To the best of my knowledge,[NL]
there is no way to aid him.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That can't be![A][NL]
There must be something![NL]
Any clue, no matter how slight[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Our oldest legends tell us just this[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Only one person has ever been able to[.][NL]
shake off the Demon King's domination.[A][NL]
Rausten's founder, Saint Latona the[.][NL]
sure-hearted, shattered his fetters.[A][NL]
If one possesses a strength of will[.][NL]
beyond that of normal men[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Only then can one throw off the[.][NL]
shackles of the Demon King.[.][A][0x02][NL]
But you saw it for yourself, Eirika,[NL]
with your own two eyes.[.][A][NL]
Your friend Lyon's body has already[.][NL]
been claimed by the Demon King.[.][A][NL]
Once it's gone that far, [.][.....]there's[.][NL]
nothing that can be done.[.][A][NL]
When the Demon King takes over someone,[.][NL]
he devours his spirit, his very soul.[.][A][NL]
Even if his hold on Lyon's body could be[NL]
released, that body would have no soul.[.][A][NL]
There is no power in Rausten[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]not[.][NL]
even the Sacred Stone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
that can perform so great a miracle[.][NL]
as to restore a shattered soul.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I understand how you feel,[NL]
but the prince is gone.[.][A][NL]
The Lyon you knew no longer[.][NL]
exists.[.][A][0x02][NL]
It's more important now that[NL]
you care for yourself.[A][NL]
If we pursue the Demon King,[NL]
we're likely to suffer for it.[A][NL]
I want you to return to Rausten[.][NL]
Palace and rest yourself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you, L'Arachel.[.][A][NL]
However, I must stay with[.][NL]
the company.[A][NL]
I have to believe there's something[.][NL]
I can do to help him.[.][A][NL]
Lyon was always so kind. He wanted[NL]
nothing more than to help people.[.][A][NL]
It's too terrible to picture him[NL]
imprisoned by the Demon King.[.][A][NL]
Imprisoned[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]with no hope[NL]
of salvation.[.][A][X]

I will bring him peace with my[NL]

I almost vanished beneath[.][NL]
the Demon King's mantle.[A][NL]
Then I remembered you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
My mind blazed into wakefulness.[A][NL]
All at once, my mind shouted[NL]
out, [0x93]I will not be devoured![0x94][A][NL]
Just as I was about to lose[.][NL]
myself to the Demon King,[.][A][NL]
I was able to drive him back.[.][A][NL]
The Demon King's desires are[NL]
simple[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]foul, but uncomplicated.[A][NL]

conquest, and subjugation of man.[.][A][NL]

go and attend Eirika.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Lord Ephraim, this is Lady Eirika's wish.[.][A][NL]
She implored us to lend our blades to you[.][NL]
on the front lines[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
She spoke to each of us individually. She[.][NL]
knelt before us and beseeched us to go.[.][A][NL]
Her sincerity, her concern[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]We could[NL]
not help but be moved by her plea.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Very well. You will all[.][NL]
come with me.[.][A][NL]
But steel yourselves. This will[.][NL]
not be an easy journey.[.][A][NL]
I want only volunteers who are[NL]
unafraid of meeting death.[A][OpenMidRight]I'll let the others know.[.][A][NL]
I must tell you, milord[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]they are[NL]
already preparing to depart.[A][NL]

and not a one will be deterred.[.][A][X]

If it please you, I would be ever so[NL]

will, won't you?[A][X]

# 0x0C1A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x2A][0x01][OpenMidLeft]I've much to do here in Jehanna.[A][NL]
I'll start with what can be done[NL]
and keep going from there.[A][NL]
First, I must talk to Mother.[.][A][NL]
She should know that we've won,[.][NL]

you have but to ask.[A][NL]
I seldom trust people who act from[NL]
purely altruistic motives[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

this away[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenFarLeft]This stone banished the Demon King.[.][A][NL]
With such power[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

back Father and Lyon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

dreadful war could be[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Eirika.[.][A][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I know, I know. Such things would be[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I cannot wish for such things.[A][NL]
No matter how it hurts, or rather because[.][NL]
it hurts, we must learn to accept sorrow.[.][A][NL]
We must take it into our hearts[.][NL]
and tame our grief[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight]Tell me, Sister[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
If Lyon were here with us, what[.][NL]
do you think he would want?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What he would want?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. You see, I think I know.[.][NL]
It was the reason for his studies.[A][NL]
It's why he wanted to know about the[NL]
Sacred Stones[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]or rather the Fire Emblem.[A][NL]
Let's take Lyon's dreams and fulfill[NL]
them in his stead.[A][NL]
We can do that, can't we? Without[.][NL]
relying on any mystic power?[A][OpenMidLeft]You're right, Brother, we can.[A][NL]
Let us fulfill his dreams.[A][NL]
As Lyon wanted, as we all want[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][0x02][NL]

I am still princess of Rausten, after all.[NL]
There is much to which I must attend.[.][A][NL]
Renais and Rausten are far apart, but[.][NL]

I cannot ignore their plight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, of course not.[.][NL]
I will ride with you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, you must remain in Renais.[A][NL]

No one desires this war.[A][NL]
So why must it continue?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Indeed.[.][A][NL]
And yet there is fighting in[NL]

In ancient times, our ancestors[.][NL]
fought all manner of evil beast.[A][NL]

man then fought against fellow man[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
So we learned from Lyon.[A][OpenMidLeft]I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But if men understand the futility[NL]

We could gain so much more by[.][NL]
cooperation than by conquest.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You may be right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But I think[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

I clutch this spear[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Brother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Perhaps it is because I am a man.[.][A][NL]

pleasure in the battle victorious.[A][NL]

The more strongly the call to arms[NL]

It may be crass and low, but I cannot[.][NL]

more for you then.[A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x22][0x01][OpenMidRight]Good day to you, Princess.[A][NL]
What a funny thing that we should meet[NL]
here! It is providence, I tell you![.][A][OpenMidLeft]L'Arachel, it is NOT providence.[NL]
It is not even a coincidence.[.][A][NL]
We agreed to meet here when we[NL]
planned out our battle strategy.[A][NL]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell me that you[NL]
don't remember that![A][OpenMidRight]We planned this?[A][NL]
I suppose I simply don't usually[NL]
worry about such trifling details.[A][NL]
And here we are, so I suppose that[NL]
our plan must be working.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I suppose you're right.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Still, divine providence or not,[NL]
isn't it strange and wonderful?[.][A][NL]
A beautiful princess traveling with[.][NL]
such a ragged bunch as this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
You could have told me much sooner,[.][NL]
you know![.][A][OpenMidLeft]My apologies.[.][A][NL]
Necessity demanded that I conceal[.][NL]
my identity at the time.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it is no longer any worry.[A][NL]
To be honest, I believe I had figured out[.][NL]
your ruse from the very moment we met.[A][NL]
I said to myself, [0x93]This lovely woman[NL]
could only be of my own superior breeding.[0x94][.][A][NL]
After all, you could never truly fool[.][NL]
a woman with my keen mind.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]My. How[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]impressive.[.][A][OpenMidRight]There is something about nobility that[NL]
simply cannot be hidden from its kin![.][A][NL]

felt the same thing upon seeing me?[.][A][NL]

carriage surpassing that of common folk?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Err[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Aheh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

something, L'Arachel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Why are you so obsessed[.][NL]
with fighting monsters?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My parents were kind people. I would[NL]
be like them if I am able.[A][NL]
My home of Rausten is so near to Darkling[.][NL]
Woods. We experienced many sudden raids.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]My parents took it upon themselves to[.][NL]
defend our people against the monsters.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I had no idea[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, but my parents are gone now.[.][A][NL]
I've been told that they passed away[NL]
when I was but an infant.[.][A][NL]
They[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]gave their lives defending[NL]
many helpless people.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'm so sorry.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, you needn't be sad. I would[.][NL]
not want for that.[A][NL]
No, it's wonderful that they gave[.][NL]
their lives battling that filth.[A][NL]
I was so young that I do not remember[.][NL]
their faces, if I must be honest.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]However, that does not diminish the[.][NL]
pride I feel for what they've done.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Don't you feel lonely at[NL]
the loss of your parents?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No! Not at all![.][A][NL]
What do you take me for?[NL]
Some kind of weakling?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I see that you are[NL]
strong indeed, L'Arachel.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I should say so.[A][NL]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]would you not say that[NL]
you are strong, too, Eirika?[A][NL]
Your father stayed in his castle,[.][NL]
fighting the forces of Grado.[.][A][NL]
He had a noble death, don't[.][NL]
you think?[A][NL]
Your father was a great man.[A][NL]
You must be quite proud of him.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]yes.[A][NL]
He refused to take even one step in retreat[.][NL]
from the advancing Grado soldiers.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]But still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I mean, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I would have thought no[.][NL]
less of him if he had fled.[.][A][NL]
Even if he were no longer a brave king[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Still[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I would be happier if he were still alive.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Eirika[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][0x02][NL]

bravery, of their honor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But I will never see them. I will[.][NL]
never know them for myself.[.][A][NL]

Don't scare me like that![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. That must have[.][NL]
seemed rather unladylike.[.][A][NL]

like this armor.[A][NL]

I think that freedom of movement is[.][NL]
far more important to me in combat.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, sure. I guess everyone has[NL]

all the scars from all your fights.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A knight's greatest pride are the scars[.][NL]

off my horse. Heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

my hide more often than I his.[A][OpenMidLeft]I doubt that. My brother rushes into[NL]
battle without thought for consequence.[.][A][NL]

last time we talked, Prince Ephraim?[A][OpenMidLeft]Sigh. High command must remain behind[.][NL]
the vanguard and let the soldiers fight.[A][NL]
And if he tries to take the van, any[NL]
unit, regardless of rank, may stop him.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, exactly. So you[NL]
do remember it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And now, every time I try to lead[.][NL]
the charge, my own men stop me![.][A][NL]

my safety when their own is at risk.[A][NL]
Look, I agreed to your plan at the[NL]

I'm going to revoke the order.[A][OpenMidRight]No, Prince! I know I've told you[NL]
this before[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

the future of Renais[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And if we fail because I do not[.][NL]
join the battle, we have no future![.][A][NL]
I do know I bear much responsibility,[.][NL]

other day, I came to a realization.[.][A][NL]
I was wrong. The decision I made you[NL]
agree to the other day was wrong.[.][A][NL]
You belong on the front lines, like[.][NL]
any of the noble warriors of Renais.[A][NL]

my worry that I couldn't fight well.[A][NL]

you as well.[A][NL]

a commander, wouldn't you say?[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't speak to me that way.[.][A][NL]
If I can save a life by taking[NL]
a risk myself, I'll do it.[A][NL]

significantly since then.[.][A][NL]

was. You were determined to win.[A][NL]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you were destined to lose that[NL]
day. Still, I was quite shocked.[A][NL]
You weren't trying to learn my skill.[.][NL]

supposed to be obedient to his master.[A][OpenMidRight]When you fight, you must respect your[.][NL]

to send you fighting against Grado?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]You've no need to worry. My reasons[.][NL]

There's nothing left for[NL]
me to teach you, it seems.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's utter nonsense. I still have[.][NL]
much to learn from you, Duessel.[A][NL]
I intend to be the greatest[.][NL]
spearman Magvel has ever known.[.][A][NL]
I gave up on swords after seeing[NL]
how they fare against spears.[.][A][NL]
Sword, axe, spear, bow[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and[.][NL]
even magic. I've seen them all.[.][A][NL]
The spear always comes out on top. And[NL]
I want mine to be the best spear around.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That's a bold statement.[A][NL]
But you may yet be the one who[NL]
can prove it true, lad.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I thank you, Duessel.[.][A][NL]
It's only because of the skills you[.][NL]
gave me that I'm alive and here now.[A][NL]
Our countries were friends, but you[.][NL]
taught me like family[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I am a warrior. All I can do is improve[.][NL]
my skills and pass them on to a student.[A][NL]
And if you best me using the skills[.][NL]

[ToggleSmile]And I am glad to be fighting at the[.][NL]
side of such a worthy student.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I know that I've been branded a[.][NL]

I regret that I betrayed my[.][NL]
emperor[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You never betrayed him.[.][A][NL]
You remain as loyal to him now[NL]
as when you swore your oaths.[.][A][NL]
No, it is Grado who has betrayed[NL]
the ideals it once held dear.[.][A][0x02][NL]
And now, as then, you are my[NL]
teacher. Nothing has changed.[.][A][NL]
No, you are no traitor. If anything,[NL]
you are the last true man of Grado.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ephraim[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes. A student should not[.][NL]
inspire his teacher.[A][NL]

I had something I wanted to ask you.[NL]
Your family, are they all soldiers?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Why do you ask?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Your skill with the spear is amazing.[.][NL]
Have you trained since you were a child?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, I come from a long line of dirt-poor[NL]
farmers. I wielded a plough, not a spear.[.][A][NL]
When we were kids, Glen and I had to[NL]
chase birds and animals from our fields.[A][NL]
We used sticks and stones, and I think[NL]
that helped with our aim, to be honest.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
So why did you join the army?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It's a funny story, really.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The emperor's caravan passed through[NL]
our village one day.[A][NL]
My brother and I watched the glorious[.][NL]
procession from the top of a tree.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Then, a stray dog started to harry the[NL]
horses pulling the emperor's carriage.[A][NL]
We threw rocks to drive off the mutt,[.][NL]
but some soldiers decided to arrest us.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Why? You were trying to help[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, well. We didn't just hit the dog.[NL]
We got a few of the soldiers as well.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah-ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
So, what happened next?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, the emperor shows up in the room[NL]
the soldiers had thrown us.[.][A][NL]
He looks around and, in this very calm[NL]
but stern voice, says to the soldiers:[A][NL]
"What are you men doing, arresting mere[.][NL]
children? They were trying to help!"[A][NL]
Then, he invites us to dine at his table,[.][NL]
and it was a luxurious feast, I tell you![.][A][NL]
Now, we were just kids. We lacked the[.][NL]
basic courtesies. We were just filthy.[A][NL]
And we kept droning on about the most[.][NL]
idiotic things: chores, the village[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But he listened to us intently, and[.][NL]
that fatherly smile never left his face.[A][NL]
And he said, [0x93]You lads are good at[NL]
driving off dogs with stones[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Your skills are wasted in the fields. Let's[.][NL]
see how you fare with spears instead.[0x94][A][OpenMidRight]And that's how you were recruited.[A][OpenMidLeft]Exactly. It's difficult to ignore[.][NL]
such a commanding presence.[.][A][NL]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the emperor changed. I still[NL]
can't believe what's happened.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was born into a family of knights, so[.][NL]
it was a given that I should be one, too.[.][A][NL]
I trained in spear and sword. I studied[.][NL]
chivalry and swore my oaths of fealty.[A][NL]
And because of my hard work, the late[.][NL]
King Fado treated me like a second son.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]It's funny. You and I are from different[NL]
worlds, but we share the same loyalties.[A][OpenMidLeft]True[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But King Fado is dead now.[A][NL]
And my emperor is the one[.][NL]
who killed him[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
My emperor is as good[.][NL]
as dead to me.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I already serve a new lord.[.][A][NL]

How are you doing?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm doing fine, thank you.[NL]
Everything is fine.[.][A][NL]
And you look like you're doing[NL]
well, too. I'm relieved.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, but it's all thanks to everyone's[NL]

I'm grateful for all the attention[NL]

a pawn, really. I don't do much[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You are too modest, Franz.[NL]
I'm telling you the truth.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you.[A][OpenMidLeft]By the way, that's a very[.][NL]
interesting satchel you have.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Huh?[A][OpenMidLeft]It's not military issue, is it?[.][A][NL]
I haven't seen any of the other[.][NL]
cavaliers carrying one like it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, this old thing? To tell you[.][NL]
the truth, I made it myself.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. This pouch holds a skin of water,[NL]

I can find everything very quickly.[.][A][NL]
Oh, and I've also fixed it so that it[.][NL]
won't shake about while I'm riding.[.][A][NL]
It's easy to carry on one shoulder or sling[.][NL]
over both. And it goes with everything.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's nice![NL]
You're so handy.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you.[NL]
It's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]probably my only redeeming trait.[.][A][NL]

How could I possibly do that?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey, I'm not saying you should go[.][NL]

sees how sharp a warrior you are.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Is that so?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, it is. And I also know that you[NL]
like to play the part of the fool[.][A][NL]
for no other reason than to give these[NL]
weary soldiers a reason to smile.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And your sword and spear skills surpass[.][NL]

Renais, Frelia, or any other kingdom.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow. Your flattery is far more[NL]
than I deserve[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]The only reason you paint is to acquire[.][NL]
a better understanding of geography,[A][NL]
so that you can use that knowledge[NL]
in battle[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
It's just a hobby.[A][NL]
Don't give me too much credit.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm not.[A][NL]

landscapes, isn't that true?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]The last portrait I ever painted[NL]
was of Mother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Mother?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Never mind. Not important.[NL]
Anyway, I'm shocked. SHOCKED.[.][A][NL]
Yeah, if you need a role model,[.][NL]
look to General Seth.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Of course I admire General Seth.[A][NL]

I got it, Franz.[A][OpenMidLeft]Good.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm not used[NL]
to being so casual.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Can I ask you, what do[NL]
you think of this war?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I still don't understand why Grado[NL]
chose to invade Renais.[.][A][NL]
Grado and Renais were allies. Their royal[.][NL]
families were close friends.[A][NL]
Why, Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika[.][NL]
are friends with your Prince Lyon.[A][NL]
I detect something funny here.[A][NL]
I simply cannot believe a friendship[NL]
so strong could end so abruptly.[A][NL]
How many lives have been destroyed by[.][NL]
such a seemingly random turn of events?[.][A][NL]
Perhaps the prince and princess know[NL]
more of the truth, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to[NL]
besmirch your homeland's name.[A][OpenMidRight]No, it's all right. I wonder what[.][NL]
drives Grado's ambitions now, too.[A][NL]
I was born in a rural village and[.][NL]
raised in Grado's countryside.[A][NL]
Ever since I was a little child,[NL]
I took pride in my home's origins.[A][NL]
Grado, of course, is named after the[NL]
legendary hero who saved all of Magvel.[.][A][NL]
I thought I lived in a country that[.][NL]
believed in justice and peace.[A][NL]
But this war[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's something[NL]
different than all that.[A][OpenMidLeft]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I'm sorry.[A][NL]
This war must be especially[.][NL]
painful for you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'll be fine, Franz.[NL]
But thank you, though.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]It was wrong of Grado to invade[.][NL]
Renais. Nothing can justify it.[.][A][NL]
Grado has no right to destroy whole[.][NL]
nations, ruin people's lives.[.][A][NL]
This is all so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]so wrong![.][A][NL]
I began this war as a soldier[.][NL]
in Grado's armies.[A][NL]
But now[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I just want to believe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I want to believe in justice! I want[NL]
to know I'm doing the right thing![A][OpenMidLeft]Amelia[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I understand it all very well. Your[.][NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x0A][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x05][0x01][OpenMidRight]Neimi. You seem to be adjusting[.][NL]
to the rigors of combat well.[.][A][NL]
You're a skilled archer after all.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm so glad to hear you say that![.][NL]
I was so sad after we talked last.[A][NL]
I didn't know what to do, but then,[.][NL]
I decided to focus on my archery.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's the spirit, Neimi. So, have[NL]
you been training by yourself?[A][NL]
I never mastered archery. I'm[.][NL]
sorry I can't help you train.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]No, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Thank you, but I've[.][NL]
been thinking about this a lot.[.][A][NL]
First, I need to sharpen my vision[NL]
so I can target more easily.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Sharpen your vision?[A][NL]
Good eyesight seems essential[.][NL]
in a good archer, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
How can you improve your[NL]
vision? I don't understand.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My grandfather taught me to stare[.][NL]
into the distance and concentrate.[A][NL]
My grandfather taught me everything[.][NL]
I know about the bow.[.][A][NL]
My grandfather was[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
He was a great archer.[A][NL]
One time, a snake was attacking a bird [.][NL]
nest on a tree in a mountain far away.[A][NL]
He aimed at the snake and shot it down.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Incredible. He was able to pick out[.][NL]
and hit a snake from that distance?[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Your grandfather must have been[.][NL]
a great archer.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, he was. And that's why I've[NL]
been staring into the distance.[.][A][NL]
I've been training constantly on the[NL]
field, and my vision has improved.[A][NL]
See that tree in the distance? I can[NL]
spot the bugs crawling on its leaves.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'll be impressed when you can[NL]
hit each of those bugs from here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that would be cruel![A][OpenMidRight]There's no need to shoot bugs. You[NL]
only need to shoot our enemies[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]using your keen eyes and the[NL]
skills your grandfather gave you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Don't you worry![NL]
You can count on me![A][ToggleSmile][X]

vision-training regimen.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah, where I stare into the[NL]
distance and concentrate?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. I've been trying it out[NL]
myself, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I've had some problems.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Problems?[.][NL]
What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Whenever I'm training, people[.][NL]
start to avoid me.[A][NL]
It's not just that. Even animals[NL]
run away from me when I'm at it.[A][OpenMidRight]And you're just[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You're just[.][NL]
staring into the distance?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. Standing perfectly still,[NL]
staring into the distance.[A][OpenMidRight]Maybe it's[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]because you look[NL]
scary[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I used to get that a lot.[.][A][NL]
Cormag said I was frightening him.[NL]
He thought I was angry at him.[A][OpenMidLeft]I look[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]scary? Hm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I have refined my stare to intimidate[.][NL]
my foes in battle. You may have a point.[A][NL]
No wonder people get scared when they[.][NL]
see me glowering into the distance.[.][A][NL]
You know, I might almost consider it[NL]
a compliment of my knightly prowess![A][OpenMidRight]I have an idea[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps if you[NL]
[ToggleSmile]smile, it might not be so scary.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Like this?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It's still scary, isn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Maybe it's because you're[.][NL]
crossing your arms.[.][A][NL]
How about[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]holding some flowers[NL]
instead? That might help.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You want me to stare into the distance[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
smiling[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and holding flowers?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I think that would look good[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You're just being nice, Neimi.[A][NL]
Your keen vision is a gift, and[.][NL]
your training may improve it[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But I know I can never imitate it.[NL]
It's yours and yours alone.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I place much faith in your[NL]
sharp eyes and your steady hand.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Th-thank you, Gilliam![NL]

[ToggleSmile]Say, Father Moulder[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You want to know about Prince[.][NL]

That's so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]embarrassing.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, no. It's not like that. I just mean[.][NL]
you are a pure, straightforward girl.[.][A][NL]
That's a compliment worthy of a knight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you think so?[NL]
Thank you, Father.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hm. Say, would you like to hear[.][NL]
a story from the prince's youth?[A][OpenMidRight]I'd like that, Father. Very much![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Oh my![A][NL]

take care of our enemies, first.[A][OpenMidRight]Look out![.][.....][NL]

Stay here, Father. I'll[.][NL]
take care of this.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I think that would be best.[A][OpenMidRight]Tell me your story another time,[NL]
though. I'd like to hear it.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'd be delighted.[.][NL]
Another time, then.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father![A][ToggleSmile][X]

# 0x0C9F
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x07][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x08][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Well, do you have time[NL]
for that story I promised?[A][OpenMidRight]Certainly, Father.[A][OpenMidLeft]It was over ten years ago, when[.][NL]
the prince was just a child.[A][NL]
There was a ceremony at the castle,[.][NL]
with a trick archer of sorts.[.][A][OpenMidRight]A trick archer?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. He was a very famous and undeniably[NL]
skilled archer from abroad.[.][A][NL]
He was to shoot a tiny target that had[NL]
been placed in the distance.[A][NL]
However, in the middle of the show,[.][NL]
someone stopped him from shooting.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It wasn't[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, it was young Prince Innes.[.][A][NL]
He said, [0x93]That's not far enough![NL]
Move the target back farther![0x94][A][NL]
Then, he insisted on trying himself.[A][OpenMidRight]That's so like him![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't it?[.][NL]
[ToggleSmile]King Hayden tried to stop him, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Well, you know how he is.[.][NL]
He doesn't listen to anyone.[A][NL]
And so, it became a contest between our[.][NL]
prince and this foreign archer.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So, what happened?[A][OpenMidLeft]First, they established the ground rules.[.][A][NL]
Each person was to shoot at the target. If[NL]
both arrows hit, they increased the range.[A][NL]
They simply continued to move the target[NL]
back until one person missed the mark.[A][OpenMidRight]Sounds simple enough.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ah, but the two were evenly matched.[NL]
Every shot was a perfect bull's-eye.[A][NL]
The crowd cheered, and the target[.][NL]
moved ever farther back[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But then it came to the turning point.[NL]
The foreign archer said, [.][A][NL]
[0x93]This is no test. Let's move the[NL]
target back more.[0x94][A][NL]
It seemed like bravado, but the archer[NL]
actually had a clever tactic in mind.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Clever? How so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]They had been shooting for some time,[.][NL]
and the archer's arms had grown weary.[A][NL]
Precision archery is far more taxing[NL]
than the battlefield, you see.[A][NL]
So even though he was a skilled archer,[.][NL]
he was at the limits of his endurance.[A][NL]
He was still hitting the mark accurately,[.][NL]
but his arm was quivering more and more.[A][NL]
Everyone knew that the prince was[.][NL]
on the verge of victory.[A][OpenMidRight]I don't understand. They were shooting at[.][NL]
the same target, shot for shot, right?[A][NL]
Why would moving the target make any[NL]
difference?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, they were still shooting at the[NL]
same target.[A][NL]
However, the archer suggested that they[.][NL]
move the target much farther away[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Much farther than any child Innes's age[.][NL]
could hope to loose an arrow to.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, that IS clever![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Even the archer, with his trained arms,[.][NL]
was firing at his maximum range.[A][NL]
In fact, he almost missed the target![.][A][NL]
Then, it was the prince's turn.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]It was clearly too far away for the[.][NL]
young prince to hit the target.[.][A][NL]
But His Highness was undeterred. He drew[NL]
his string and fired up into the sky.[.][A][NL]
The arrow did not merely hit the target.[NL]
No, it was a perfect bull's-eye![A][NL]
You see, the prince arced his shot[NL]
to extend his range beyond its limits.[A][NL]
To hit a target this way requires[.][NL]
incredible skill, but the prince did it.[A][NL]
And then he turned to the archer and said,[NL]
[0x93]Shall we move the target back farther?[0x94][A][NL]
The archer looked so crestfallen. He[NL]
admitted defeat, and it was settled.[A][OpenMidRight]That's amazing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]That it is.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you very much, Father[.][NL]
Moulder! That's incredible![.][A][NL]
I'm even more[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]More[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]what?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
No, nothing.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm glad you liked the story.[.][A][NL]

know what to expect from my troops.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I was worried about how well you[NL]

appreciate your thoughtfulness.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x2B][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x07][0x01][OpenMidRight]Syrene, you said you'd already learned[NL]
everything about our little band.[.][A][NL]
Did anyone in Frelia go over the details[NL]
with you before you left?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, Father. Things were rather hectic in[NL]
Frelia before we left, as you know.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Everything I have learned, I've[.][NL]
learned on the job, so to speak.[A][NL]
People[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]confide in me, and I[NL]
learn by observation.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Interesting. So, even though you're new,[NL]
they know they can confide in you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes. The ladies seem most[.][NL]
comfortable speaking to me.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I understand. Even a man of the cloth[.][NL]
is still, at heart, a man.[A][NL]
It must reassure them to know that there[NL]
is another woman to whom they can speak.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]There are many women among us.[A][NL]
If I cannot be [0x93]father[0x94] to them, please,[NL]
care for them as a mother.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]With all respect, Father, I refuse to[.][NL]
minister to their needs as a mother would.[A][NL]
I am still young and unworthy. I prefer[.][NL]
to speak to them as a sister.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Yes, of course.[.][NL]
Please excuse me.[.][A][NL]
Help them, then, as a sister would.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, Father! Now, may I have a[NL]
word with you? As their sister?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I beg your pardon? [.][.....]Me?[.][.....] What?[A][NL]
Has someone[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]complained about me?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I'll let you know the[.][NL]
day after next new moon.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Must I wait until then?[.][A][NL]
Is it so terrible that I needs[NL]
must prepare myself for the news?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rest easy, Father! It's only[NL]
a suggestion, not criticism.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]What could it be?[.][A][X]

# 0x0CA6
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x07][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x2B][0x01][OpenMidLeft]So[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Last night was a new moon.[NL]
And that means today is the day.[A][NL]
I've been going mad wondering,[NL]
Syrene. What is your suggestion?[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, right you are, Father. It is[NL]
indeed the promised day.[A][NL]
Well, then. On behalf of everyone,[NL]
I have two words for you.[.][A][NL]
Father Moulder?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Happy Birthday![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What? Birthday?[.][A][NL]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh, yes! Why, today is[NL]
my birthday, isn't it? But[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It is a fine tradition to celebrate[.][NL]
one's birthday, Father.[.][A][NL]
In a war, uncertainty surrounds us[NL]
every moment of every day.[A][NL]
Instead of worrying about tomorrow,[.][NL]
let us celebrate life today.[A][NL]
That should encourage us all to[.][NL]
keep going, wouldn't you say?[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, indeed. To share the joys of life[NL]
is very important.[A][NL]
Thank you, Syrene. In this chaos, I[.][NL]
would have forgotten my own birthday.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You exhaust yourself caring for others,[.][NL]
but you pay no attention to yourself.[.][A][NL]
We are all so grateful to you, Father.[A][NL]
So many different people came up to me[NL]
to ask how we could show that gratitude.[A][NL]
You are a man of great virtue, and[NL]
an inspiration to us all.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I am touched[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
At my age, I thought all my happy[.][NL]
birthdays were well behind me.[A][NL]
I'm a little embarrassed at that[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You must remember to take care of[.][NL]
yourself, Father. And thank you.[A][X]

talk like that when we're alone.[A][OpenMidRight]But we ARE on duty.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Let me put it this way, then.[.][A][NL]
This is an order from your captain![.][A][NL]
When we're alone, you are to speak to me [.][NL]
as if we are at home.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, ma'am![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Vanessa. Sigh.[NL]
Did you listen to a word I said?[A][OpenMidRight]Y-yes.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! Yes, that's it![.][A][NL]
Oh, by the way, I have something for you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What is it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Here you go.[A][NL]
Father wanted me to give it to you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But this is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
The war god Fale's amulet![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, this is a battle amulet.[.][NL]
I received one before I left home, too.[.][A][NL]
You were summoned so suddenly that Father[.][NL]
didn't get a chance to give it to you.[A][NL]
And Mother wanted to tell you,[NL]
[0x93]Never be apart from this amulet.[0x94][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]She also wanted you to relax and do [NL]

And to get a good night's sleep always.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I do try.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Maybe others don't notice, [.][NL]
but I know you too well, Vanessa.[.][A][NL]
I know you don't get enough rest when[.][NL]
you feel overwhelmed with responsibility.[.][A][NL]
But, to be at your best, you need to take [NL]
care of yourself, OK?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, ma'am[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]I mean, Sis.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'll be right by your side tonight,[.][NL]

Did you sleep well?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. First time in a long time.[.][NL]
Thank you, Sis.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I've been meaning to ask you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]You don't seem to have much [NL]

So, who's the lucky guy?[A][OpenMidRight]What?! That's just crazy![.][NL]
I don't know what you're talking about![.][A][OpenMidLeft]You know I can tell when you're lying.[NL]
Plus, you not eating is a dead giveaway.[A][NL]
I mean, when's the last time you said no[NL]
to a cookie? It's not a criticism.[A][NL]
One of your most charming qualities is [.][NL]
how you can outeat anyone.[A][NL]
It's because of someone special, isn't it?[A][OpenMidRight]Well, um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]But, Vanessa, first and foremost,[.][NL]
you have to take care of yourself.[A][NL]
I'll support you no matter what, but [.][NL]
no one is worth losing your health over.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, I guess. I'll do my best[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Sometimes I think that if I were more [NL]
like you[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]you know, a great knight,[.][A][NL]
an attractive woman, and just [NL]
all-around perfect[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I'd have a better chance with him.[NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Hmmm. That didn't sound as pathetic [NL]
in my head as it did out loud.[A][OpenMidLeft]Don't be silly, Vanessa.[NL]
You may not know it,[A][NL]
but I'm sure that person likes you for[NL]
who you are.[A][OpenMidRight]Do you really think so?[.][A][NL]
I've always wanted to be like you.[NL]
You've always been my role model.[.][A][NL]
But, I feel like whenever I finally[.][NL]
catch up to you, you're already gone.[.][A][NL]
You've already moved on.[A][NL]
I'll never catch up with you, [NL]
no matter how hard I try.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm very proud of you, Vanessa.[.][A][NL]
And as your older sister, I recognize [NL]
your talent more than anyone else.[A][NL]
You should be more confident.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I feel better after opening up to you.[A][NL]
It's hard not to compare myself with you,[.][NL]
but I have to get past that.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's the spirit. And remember, [.][NL]

I quit comparing myself with you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You might not know this, but there's[NL]
something about you I've always envied.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]About me?[.][.....][NL]

I will never be able to match.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Inner[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]fortitude?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Do you remember when Father collapsed?[A][NL]
Mother and I were so panicked that [.][NL]
we didn't know what to do.[A][NL]
You were the youngest of us all,[A][NL]
but you gathered nuts in your small hands[.][NL]
and went to the village to sell them.[.][A][NL]
Then you came home with medicine for him.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know what to say.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]When you face a difficult circumstance,[.][NL]
your true self emerges.[.][A][NL]
You were very young, but had the presence[.][NL]
of mind and ingenuity to help Father.[.][A][NL]
You comforted me and Mother, and you[NL]
rescued Father.[.][A][NL]
I've always respected your strength,[NL]
and wished for some of it myself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you were the one who joined [NL]
the Knights at such an early age,[.][A][NL]
and it was you who supported our family.[A][OpenMidRight]I emulated your strength. [NL]
I wanted to support my family like you did.[.][A][NL]
It's always been my goal. And I respect [NL]
you more than anyone else.[A][NL]
I wish you could be as confident in yourself[NL]
as I am of you.[.][A][NL]
No matter what, you'll always be all right.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]All right, then. I have to tell you![NL]

wait for you two with Father and Mother.[A][NL]
We'll make your favorite meal[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Is that enough to convince you?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][NL]

I'm captain of Frelia's pegasus knights.[A][NL]
And this here is Titania. We're both [.][NL]
pleased to meet you, Lute.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ah, the pegasus, the proud, winged horse.[.][A][NL]
You know, they only attach to someone they[NL]
accept as their master.[.][A][NL]
And did you know that pegasi fly by kicking[.][NL]
the air, not by flapping their wings.[.][A][NL]
It's a common misconception, but wings[NL]
are mainly used for gliding.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, as captain, I learned all[NL]
this long ago. [.][A][NL]
Plus, if they flapped their wings constantly,[.][NL]
no one would be able to ride them.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]In some countries, the word pegasus [NL]
means [0x93]fountain[0x94] or [0x93]ocean.[0x94][A][NL]
Different cultures have different stories[.][NL]
about the creation of the pegasus.[A][NL]
In one legend, there was a monster who[NL]
could turn anyone into stone.[.][A][NL]
When the monster died, its blood seeped into[NL]
the ground. There, a pegasus was born. [.][A][OpenMidLeft]Interesting[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You are very knowledgeable.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I know.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Well! Thank you for the lesson. [NL]

strong impression on you, Lute. [A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....] So, what can I do for you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's common knowledge that pegasi have[NL]
strong resistance to magic.[.][A][NL]
I developed a new counterattack to that [NL]
power, but it still needs refining.[.][A][NL]
I guess what I'm saying is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
Can I try it out on Titania?[A][OpenMidLeft]What?![A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]No! Of course not![A][OpenMidRight]I was joking.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Sigh. You said it with such[.][NL]
a straight face[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
You definitely had me fooled.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Thank you! That's so sweet of you to say.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]It wasn't a compliment![.][A][NL]
Besides, you really don't seem like someone[.][NL]
who has much of a sense of humor.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is that right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]And it seems like your magic [.][NL]
is the real thing.[A][NL]
When you defeated the enemy the other day,[NL]
I saw a sharp flash of magic from above.[A][OpenMidRight]Gee, I wonder why that happened[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Because[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]you're good?[A][OpenMidRight]Why, yes! You are 100 percent[.][NL]
correct! For once.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]My point is, we don't have enough mages [NL]
in Frelia, so we're counting on you.[A][NL]
When I was growing up, I always wanted[NL]
to be a pegasus knight like my sister.[A][NL]
I was also interested in magic, but[.][NL]
I just didn't have the talent.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well, you are a great pegasus knight, [NL]

loosen up and not be so serious.[A][NL]

Yes, I'm fine. I'm glad YOU are fine, sir.[A][OpenMidLeft]Good, Vanessa.[A][NL]
Your contributions to this war and also to[NL]
Frelia as a whole have been very valuable.[A][OpenMidRight]Thank you for your kind words, sir.[.][A][NL]
I was so worried when a messenger from [.][NL]
Carcino told us you were in danger.[.][A][NL]
I worried for your safety.[A][OpenMidLeft]Nothing is going to happen to me.[.][A][NL]
It's still very strange to me that[NL]
you are grown up and worry about me now.[A][NL]
When you first joined the knights, [.][NL]

they were only about an arm length apart.[.][A][NL]

strong accuracy and concentration.[A][NL]

In many ways, she was very[NL]

I'm feeling pretty great![.][A][OpenMidRight]You can't fight on an empty stomach.[A][NL]
Eating is very important to keep up [NL]
your strength. Especially breakfast.[A][NL]
I've heard that in some cultures, they call[.][NL]
breakfast [0x93]first break.[0x94][A][OpenMidLeft]What's that? What do they break?[A][OpenMidRight]A fast.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A fast what? Huh? Speak plainly! I don't[NL]
understand all this talking in circles.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]We don't eat anything while we sleep,[.][NL]
so it's as if we are fasting.[.][A][NL]
So, the meal you eat in the morning[.][NL]
breaks that fast.[.][A][NL]
This means that breakfast is an [NL]
especially important meal.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh. Who would have thunk it?[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]The only thing I consumed this[NL]
morning was knowledge![A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Just that I make it a point[.][NL]
to learn other disciplines.[.][A][NL]
You have to if you want to[NL]
grow as a fighter.[A][OpenMidRight]I completely agree.[.][A][NL]

fighters had to learn many disciplines[A][NL]
in case they had to fill in for a [NL]
wounded teammate.[.][A][NL]
I've always wanted to learn archery.[A][NL]
The delicate precision is the opposite of[.][NL]
fighting with an axe.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Me, too. Why don't we meet sometime[.][NL]

My daily chores involved swinging an axe,[.][NL]

it? You'd make better use of it.[A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x09][0x01][OpenMidRight]Hey, you![.][A][OpenMidLeft]I hope that maniac isn't talking to me.[.][NL]
I'll pretend I can't hear him. La la la.[A][OpenMidRight]You, over there! Mage woman![A][OpenMidLeft]Are you talking to me? Firstly, my name[.][NL]
isn't [0x93]Mage Woman,[0x94] nor is it [0x93]You.[0x94][A][NL]
Why don't you lower your voice and[NL]
act a little more civilized? Who are you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I'm son of the warrior Garcia, Ross.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]So you're [0x93]Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross.[0x94][.][NL]
That's an unusual name. [A][NL]
I'm Lute, genius mage extraordinaire. [NL]
You've probably heard of me.[A][NL]
So, Sir Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross, [NL]
how may I be of service to you?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]My name is ROSS! You're kind of weird.[.....][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Hey, you can use magic, right?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, although to be more accurate,[NL]
I don't just [0x93]use[0x94] magic.[.][A][NL]
I am a master of all magic. [NL]
Please don't make that mistake again.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Wow, that's really great.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, maybe for you. For me, I'm[NL]
just that good. It's normal.[A][OpenMidRight]Isn't it hard to remember all those spells?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I think for the average person,[.][NL]
it probably is a difficult task.[A][NL]
But for me, it is as simple as using a[NL]
hint of fragrance when baking a cake.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]have no idea what you mean.[.][.....][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Wait a second![A][NL]

question for a little bit before you answer.[A][OpenMidLeft]OK. Bye.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Hey! [.][NL]

You left in the middle [.][NL]
of the conversation![A][OpenMidRight]Thank you, but it's no big deal.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]That wasn't a compliment![.][.....][A][0x02][NL]
[ToggleSmile]So, by the way[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]So long.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What the heck? Hey, wait a minute![NL]
I was telling you not to leave suddenly![A][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10][0x01][OpenMidRight]What do you want?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, nothing in particular. I just thought[.][NL]
we could chat[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]or something.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, THAT doesn't sound very productive [.][NL]
nor strategically important, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
If you want to, please go ahead.[A][OpenMidLeft]OK. Um. Let's see. What to talk about.[.....][NL]
You know, my mom used a little magic, too.[A][NL]
She passed away a while ago[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But, that's why I thought I might be able[.][NL]
to use magic, too.[A][NL]
Last time, you said no right away, but[NL]
you hadn't heard the whole story.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you want to be a mage?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]No, not exactly.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, then you should keep following [.][NL]
your own instinct instead.[A][NL]
Everyone has his or her own talent.[.][A][NL]
I figure the path you are taking now is [NL]
appropriate for you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah.[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Maybe you're right.[.][A][NL]
Well, it's not like I was torn between [.][NL]
the two or anything.[A][NL]
I kinda just wanted to talk with [.][NL]
a female mage like you. Thanks.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Um, you're welcome, I guess.[NL]
I'm glad I could be of your service.[A][X]

I've been looking for someone around my age.[NL]
Let's hang out sometime, OK?[A][OpenMidLeft]Sure, but do we have to wait until[NL]
[0x93]sometime[0x94]? How about now?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What are you saying?[NL]
We're in the middle of a battle![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The others are fighting well, so the[NL]
two of us won't make much difference.[.][A][NL]

magic the other day, I'm pretty good.[.][A][NL]
If something does happen, we'll be OK.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm pretty confident in my [.][NL]
skills, too.[A][NL]
But, you know--how to put this delicately--[.][NL]
it's the matter of morale. [.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You certainly are dedicated.[.....][NL]
[ToggleSmile]That's a surprise.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Why don't you prove your dedication[.][NL]
by answering this brainteaser?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Like a riddle? Sounds fun![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. It'll be really fun to watch you[.][NL]
struggling to come up with an answer. Ha![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! What's that supposed to mean?[NL]
Well, whatever. Let's do it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]OK, here it is.[.][NL]
Ross, do you know what a balance is?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Of course I do! Who doesn't?[A][NL]
It's a type of scale with small plates[NL]
on both sides to put weights.[.][A][NL]
When both sides are the same weight,[NL]
it balances.[A][NL]
So that was the riddle? Easy![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! You're too funny! No, that was [.][NL]
just the setup for the brainteaser.[.][A][NL]
Here's the real question.[.][NL]
Assume there are 25 pebbles.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pebbles?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, they're really small. As small as peas.[NL]
They are all the same color and shape.[A][NL]
In this group, there's one pebble that's[NL]
lighter than all the other pebbles.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]And I must tell you the way to [.][NL]
find that pebble?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Of course not. [.][NL]
What kind of challenge is that?[.][A][NL]
The question is, how many times do you need[.][NL]
to use the balance to find that one rock?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]How many times? Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
It's not[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]24, is it?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What?![......][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh! Ha ha ha ha ha![.][NL]
That's the first time I've heard that one![A][NL]
I see. So you were thinking that you'd [.][NL]
measure the pebbles one by one![.][A][NL]
That's great, Ross! You're too funny![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's not a compliment, is it.[.][NL]
You think I'm an idiot![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's not true.[.....][NL]
Actually, it is. Ha ha ha![A][NL]
And did I mention how[.][NL]
perceptive you are, too?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, you! Just you wait! I'll figure it out![.][NL]
I just need some time to think about it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The anticipation is killing me.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x21][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x09][0x01][OpenMidRight]Hey, you![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, hi, Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I have an answer for your brainteaser![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You got it, huh? That's amazing![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Y-yeah.[.][NL]
The answer is[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes, yes?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Four times![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You must have worked really hard to figure[NL]
that out![.][A][OpenMidRight]See! See! I told you I'd get it![NL]
Fighting's not the only thing I'm good at.[A][OpenMidLeft]However, that's not the correct answer.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What do you mean?[.][NL]
I can't believe it! Ugh![A][NL]
If that's not the right answer, then [.][NL]
what is?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You were close. [NL]
The right answer is three times.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Only three times?[.][NL]
How? Tell me![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]The key is how many pebbles you put on the[NL]
scales at first.[A][NL]
First, put eight rocks each on either side [.][NL]
of the scale.[.][A][NL]
The side with the lighter rock will be[NL]
higher than the other, right?[.][A][NL]
Or, if the sides are balanced, it means that[NL]
the lighter rock is in the rest of the pile.[A][NL]
So that was one turn on the balance. [.][NL]
The rest is pretty easy to figure out.[A][NL]
Let's assume that the lighter rock was[NL]
in the remaining pile of nine rocks[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Then you'd put three rocks on each side of[NL]
the scale. So that's the second turn.[.][A][NL]
If either side of the scale tips, then[NL]
the rock is in one of those two piles.[A][NL]
If the scale is balanced, then the rock[.][NL]
is one of the remaining three rocks.[A][NL]
So, now you've figured out which group[NL]
of three pebbles has the lighter one.[.][A][NL]
What you do now is put one rock from this[.][NL]
pile on each side of the scale.[.][A][NL]
Like before, if the scale tips to one side, [NL]
the lighter pebble is on the scale.[.][A][NL]
If the scale is balanced, then the[NL]
remaining pebble is the lighter one.[A][NL]
And that was the last turn on the[.][NL]
scale. Did you get all that?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? Well, I think I got it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What?! I just explained it all very clearly.[NL]
You still don't get it? That's really[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Really what?![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Um, nothing. Forget it. A ha ha ha ha![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][0x93]A ha ha ha[0x94] what? [.][NL]
What do you mean [0x93]forget it[0x94]?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Anyway, it's been fun hanging out.[NL]
Let's get together again sometime, OK?[A][OpenMidRight]It wasn't fun for me at all! Hey![.][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x21][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x09][0x01][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hi, Ross.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, it's you again.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That brainteaser was fun, huh?[NL]
Did you get it yet?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I already told you I didn't[.][NL]
have any fun![.][A][NL]
If that's what you consider fun, you[NL]
must have had a pretty bad childhood![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Well, I was an orphan.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]My sister and I were abandoned when I was[.][NL]
really young, before I could even talk.[.][A][NL]
She became a dancer and raised me all on[NL]
her own.[A][NL]
I'm really grateful for her.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You were an orphan?[.][A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I-I'm sorry. I had no idea.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]How could you know? Don't worry about it.[.][NL]
I don't even remember being abandoned.[A][NL]
And because of that, I got a chance to [.][NL]
travel around, and meet lots of people.[.][A][NL]
Like you. So, I'm not sad at all.[.][A][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[0x02][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][0x8017][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, I just had a great idea.[.][NL]
Let's be brothers?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Huh?! Like blood brothers? I'm really not[.][NL]
into slicing myself up for people I just met.[.][A][OpenMidRight]No, no, no. Just, you know, brothers![.][NL]
Now call me [0x93]Bro,[0x94] Bro![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] OK[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Bro.[A][OpenMidRight]Say it like you mean it![.....][NL]
Oh, never mind. It'll just sound forced.[A][OpenMidLeft]I told you so.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, just call me Ross for now.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]But, you can consider me a brother[NL]
from now on.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]What do you mean by that?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I mean that I will be a friend who[NL]
you can rely on and trust completely.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's very kind, considering I really[NL]
haven't known you for very long.[A][NL]
But thank you. You're a nice guy, even[NL]
if you're not very sharp.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! No need to insult me![NL]
A simple [0x93]Thanks, Bro[0x94] will be enough![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha ha ha. You're so funny![NL]
By the way, do you have a girlfriend?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]W-what! Of course not! Did you forget? [.][NL]
We're in the middle of a war right now![.][A][NL]
I have to focus on that![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Huh.[.....][NL]
A ha ha ha ha![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that for?[NL]
How about you? Do you have one?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I have a lot of them![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?! A lot of them![.][NL]
Oh well. We're still pretty young.[A][NL]
Better to not get tied down.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Good luck, Ross![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Don't talk like it's not your problem, too![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Ross.[A][NL]
I think we're going to be friends for a long[NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1B][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x09][0x01][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Ahem.[A][NL]
Are you Sir Gerik by any chance?[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you want, boy?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, my name is Ross.[NL]
I'm the son of warrior Garcia.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
So, Ross, are you an axeman?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah! Don't be fooled by my appearance.[.][NL]
I'm actually pretty good.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! If you say so.[A][OpenMidRight]Well, I think so. [NL]
But it's important to keep improving.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Why is that so important to you?[A][OpenMidRight]My father is such an amazing warrior.[.][A][NL]
I've always wanted to be worthy of[NL]
the title [0x93]son of Garcia.[0x94][A][NL]
And I want to be able to go home and [.][NL]
rebuild my village.[.][A][NL]
After that, I want to go on a voyage and[NL]
train in the open ocean.[A][NL]
And after that, I'd like to go back home.[.][A][NL]
To do all this, I need to be the best[.][NL]
warrior I can be.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Those are admirable goals. [.][NL]
I'll help you out sometime.[.][A][OpenMidRight]How? You'll give me a lesson?[.][.....][NL]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Are you serious? That's great![A][OpenMidLeft]I might not be able to beat your father,[NL]
but I could teach you a thing or two.[.][A][NL]
Why don't you try landing a hit on me?[A][OpenMidRight]That'd be great! But before we start,[.][NL]
let me go practice on those guys first![.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidLeft]It's great that he's so eager to learn,[.][NL]
but he's really not ready to go solo yet![.][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x09][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1B][0x01][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ross, didn't you say that you wanted to go [.][NL]
on an ocean voyage to train yourself?[.][A][NL]
The sea is a great place to train because[.][NL]
it strengthens both the mind and body.[A][OpenMidLeft]Have you ever been on a voyage?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of course. I've escorted many commercial [.][NL]
ships before.[.][A][NL]
It's embarrassing, but I got seasick for [.][NL]
the first few days.[.][A][NL]
That was very painful.[NL]
But I got used to it in a few days.[.][A][NL]
It was a long trip. Nature was more brutal[NL]
than the enemies who pursued us.[A][NL]
But after the voyage ended, I realized that[.][NL]
I grew up a lot.[A][NL]
The sea is an amazing combination of [.][NL]
brutality and expansiveness.[A][OpenMidLeft]Now I definitely want to go on a [.][NL]
sea voyage.[.][A][OpenMidRight]By the way, Ross, how's your injury from[NL]
our last session?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that little thing? It healed right up![A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
You sure are tough, boy![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Sir Gerik?[A][OpenMidRight]Yes?[A][OpenMidLeft]What should I do to be strong like you?[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's a tough question[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I would [.][NL]
have to say that it's all in the mind.[A][OpenMidLeft]Mind?[.][A][OpenMidRight]If your desire to win is stronger than your[.][NL]
opponent's, you've already won.[.][A][NL]
Your mind is your most important weapon.[A][OpenMidLeft]Come to think of it, I have noticed that.[.][A][NL]
At our last lesson, before we even started,[.][NL]
I was thinking that I could never win.[A][NL]
I guess it was like admitting defeat before[.][NL]
even trying.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]All right! You've convinced me![.][A][NL]
I'll start strengthening my mind as well[NL]
as my axe skills.[.][A][NL]
Thank you, Sir Gerik.[.][NL]
I can't wait until our next lesson![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][.....][OpenMidRight]His energy is refreshing, but I must teach[NL]
him patience next time.[.][A][X]

# 0x0CC7
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x09][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1B][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Hey, Sir Gerik[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it, Ross? You seem down today.[A][OpenMidLeft]Why is the sword stronger than the axe?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What are you talking about?[.][NL]
Just use a stronger axe to beat a sword.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's not what I mean![.][A][NL]
I want to be strong enough to split[.][NL]
a silver sword with an iron axe.[A][OpenMidRight]Your father[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What about him?[.][A][OpenMidRight]He could defeat many swordsmen[NL]
with just one axe.[A][OpenMidLeft]So you've seen him in battle?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Just once.[NL]
He was leading a unit of the Renais army.[.][A][NL]
He was swinging his axe at the front line.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Wow, my dad was really strong, wasn't he![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]He was more than just strong. [NL]
He was like a war god.[A][NL]
I have to be honest with you, Ross.[.][NL]
I was on his enemy side at the time.[A][OpenMidLeft]What?![A][OpenMidRight]I was a mercenary hired by the other side.[A][NL]
It was a fierce battle against Garcia's[.][NL]
unit, and we ultimately had to retreat.[.][A][NL]
Come to think of it, this is a perfect [.][NL]
example of the power of the mind.[.][A][NL]
You see, I was so intimidated by Garcia that[NL]
I had lost even before I started.[.][A][NL]
That was an unforgettable failure for me.[.][A][NL]
After that, I swore to myself that I would [.][NL]
be as strong as him with a sword.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Wow, I can't believe Dad beat you down [.][NL]
like that! He's the greatest.[.][A][NL]
But you're pretty great, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Someone who lost to your father?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yeah![.][A][NL]
You might have lost that time, but you [.][NL]
became a great swordsman because of it![.][A][NL]
OK. I'm going to stop moping around.[A][NL]
From this moment on, I swear that someday [NL]
I will destroy swords with my axe.[A][NL]
You are my witness, Sir Gerik![A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Truly, you are the son[NL]
of the warrior Garcia.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's not all! I'm also the best student of[NL]
the master swordsman Gerik![.][A][OpenMidRight]When did you become my student?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When I met you![.][......][NL]
Oh![.][....] Enemy detected![A][NL]
I'll catch you later![.][NL]
Give me another lesson someday, Sir Gerik.[A][NL]
I'll be much stronger by then, and maybe[NL]
I'll win a match with you![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I believe he will surpass Garcia someday.[.][A][ToggleSmile][X]

tried to shoot me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]W-well, Colm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

that there is a woman sword fighter here.[.][A][NL]
Apparently, she's very talented and was [NL]
hired for an unbelievable sum.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A woman sword fighter??[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Rumor is that if you speak to her[.][NL]
without thinking,[.][A][NL]
she's likely to attack you out of nowhere![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Is that so.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Maybe her face is scarred from[NL]
fighting. Yeah, that's probably it![.][A][NL]
She's beautiful, but has a very sad[.][NL]
past behind that scar.[A][NL]
And that's why she's so scary![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]A scarred face?[.][NL]
A sad past?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Or maybe it's because her lover was[.][NL]
killed, and she's trying to avenge him.[.][A][NL]
That seems equally plausible, doesn't it?[.][A][NL]

in Jehanna. He was also a mercenary.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see why you're so good.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ever since I was a child, my father [NL]
taught me how to live as a mercenary.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Since you were a kid?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]The harsh conditions of Jehanna breed[.][NL]
strength and ruthlessness.[A][NL]
The only way to survive is by being [NL]
a mercenary.[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight]Oh.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]My father is my parent, my teacher, and [NL]
above all, a mountain I must conquer.[.][A][OpenMidRight]A mountain?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Once I conquer the mountain, I can[NL]
accomplish anything I want.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That must be a[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]big mountain.[.][.....][NL]

My secret?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You're a thief, too, aren't you?[A][NL]
Do you think that's acceptable behavior[.][NL]
for someone in the princess's entourage?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! Where'd you learn a big word[NL]
like entourage, boy?[A][NL]
Not that it's any of your business,[.][A][NL]
but Her Highness already knows about [.][NL]
my[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]hobbies.[A][NL]
You're not, by any chance, trying to[NL]
threaten me, are you?[.][A][NL]
That's funny. I never thought I'd be[NL]
reprimanded by a boy![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey, old man, don't you talk down to ME![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I'm not a boy. I'm Colm![NL]
And I'm not threatening you, either.[A][NL]
I was just surprised that you're a thief[NL]
because you dress so nicely.[A][OpenMidLeft]I assume you're in the same trade. [.][NL]
Those rags are a dead giveaway.[.][A][NL]
Well, you may not take any pride in your[NL]
appearance, but I'm different.[A][NL]
Do you see this jacket?[.][A][NL]
It has silk embroidery, a trend that [.][NL]
I started in Carcino.[.][A][NL]
Where are the stitches, you ask?[A][NL]
They're on the inside of the jacket.[NL]
But I'm not going to show you.[A][NL]
The truly cultured man cares about [.][NL]
every detail.[.][A][NL]
It would be a waste of my time to even[NL]
try to explain it to a poor urchin like you.[A][OpenMidRight]Why are you bragging about something[NL]
so lame?[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]And I'm not a poor urchin! Man, I've [.][NL]
never met anyone as annoying as you![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, don't be so sensitive, little urchin.[.][A][NL]
If you want to be like me, make more money.[.][NL]
Improve your skills.[A][NL]
The name of the game is making money. [NL]
Money is all that matters.[A][NL]
It's your only way out.[.][NL]
Work hard and escape from poverty.[A][OpenMidRight]First of all, I don't want to be like you![NL]

[ToggleSmile]I heard that your dad is a wealthy [.][NL]
merchant in Carcino.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. So what?[.][A][NL]
My father is a wealthy merchant,[NL]
and his son is a thief.[.][A][NL]
Great family, huh?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you're rich, you don't need to steal.[NL]
You can just buy whatever you want.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You are so green, boy. Greener than the [NL]
fruit I left out for a month.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What's that supposed to mean?[.][A][NL]
I've never had dried fruit, so I don't[NL]
know what you're talking about![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, that's too bad.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Listen, urchin. Merchants are always[NL]
stingy. It's part of who they are.[A][NL]
And my father was especially stingy. [.][NL]
He gave us nothing for free.[A][NL]
We had to work for everything we had.[.][A][NL]
So my brothers and I learned the value of[.][NL]
hard work from a young age.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]And this just happens to be my job.[.][NL]
Get it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's not easy being the son of a [.][NL]
merchant, huh?[A][NL]
Forced to work from a young age.[NL]
I had a tough childhood, too. [A][NL]
I always had to hunt and garden with [.][NL]
my dad.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I guess our lives aren't so different [NL]
after all, huh.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Er, a little hunting and gardening [.][NL]
is quite different from actual work.[A][NL]
You can see that just by looking[NL]
at how you and I turned out.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well! I'll show you![A][NL]
Maybe you'll wake up one morning and find[.][NL]
that something important to you is gone![A][NL]
Consider yourself warned, old man![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You know,[.][A][NL]
warning people of your plans isn't really[.][NL]
the most effective thieving strategy.[.][A][NL]
Anyhow, I look forward to seeing[NL]
what you can muster.[A][X]

I haven't heard you bragging in a while.[A][NL]
I thought maybe you gave up on your [NL]
big plans.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm more persistent than you think I am.[NL]
I came to see you because I remembered--[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Wait, you haven't noticed yet?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Noticed what?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha! I won![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What? Did you actually steal something?[.][....][NL]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A ha![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]So you finally noticed![.][A][NL]
Yes, I secretly stole only the embroidery[.][NL]
off your precious jacket.[.][A][NL]
So, how's that for stealth? That's some[.][NL]
pretty fine thieving, if I do say so myself.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see. The embroidery IS missing.[.][NL]
Good work.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]It's a little early for a victory[.][NL]
celebration, though.[A][NL]
The embroidery was of a pony, correct?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh? Yeah[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Unfortunately for you, that was a fake.[.][A][NL]
I knew you would try to steal it, so I[NL]
replaced it with a fake beforehand.[.][A][NL]
The real embroidery is of a phoenix.[NL]
But I won't show it to you. Nope, never.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveFarRight][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You! That's a cheap trick![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarRight]In this business, anything goes.[A][NL]
However, I'm impressed that you got[.][NL]
as far as you did.[A][NL]
I definitely don't want you for an enemy.[.][A][OpenLeft]Heh heh heh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Same here, I guess.[NL]

having trouble falling asleep.[A][NL]
She kept pacing.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Having trouble falling asleep?[ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yup.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's not good.[A][NL]
It's very important for her to get enough[.][NL]
rest during this tough march.[.][A][NL]
This war has been very hard for[.][NL]
Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika.[.][A][NL]
I'm sure she's probably spent a few [NL]
nights worrying, but--[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! I just remembered that I have this[.][NL]
secret remedy my mother used to make.[.][A][NL]
It started off as a freckle cream,[A][NL]
but it turns out that it works pretty well [.][NL]
with insomnia, too.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really.[.][NL]
That's a good idea.[.][A][NL]

to tell you about her.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm so glad to hear that, Kyle. Let me [.][NL]

Long-distance relationships can be hard.[A][NL]
I can't believe it! [NL]
Stuffy old Kyle is in love![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]In love? Me?[NL]
I think you're confused.[A][NL]
Meriella is not my girlfriend.[NL]
She is one of my teammates.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Workplace romance, is it?[.][NL]
Say no more. I understand.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Just shut up and listen to me.[A][NL]
Meriella is the alias we use for Renais[.][NL]
knights on undercover missions.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Alias? Like a secret code?[A][OpenMidRight]Precisely.[A][NL]
We send mail addressed to Meriella, which [NL]
only the Renais knights know.[.][A][NL]
The contents are always the same:[.][A][NL]
We let them know that Prince Ephraim and [.][NL]
Princess Eirika are safe.[.][A][NL]
It's all written in secret code.[NL]
That's the letter I was sending.[A][OpenMidLeft]Even though we're in the middle of a war,[.][NL]
does it really have to be so complicated?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. Better to be safe than sorry.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[A][NL]
Well, would you like me to deliver that[.][NL]
letter?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]No. Every single soldier is[.][NL]
important in this war.[A][NL]
We need you here.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][NL]
You value my service? Neat![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Yes.[.][A][NL]
Although you do bring me some pointless [NL]
tidbits, you have also been a big help.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Great! This is so encouraging![A][NL]
Until recently, I thought I'd never have[NL]
any real connection with the knights.[.][A][NL]
But it's different now.[.][A][NL]
Now, I consider everyone involved in this [NL]
war, especially the knights like you,[.][A][NL]

Yes, well, that is interesting.[.][A][0x02][NL]
If my memory serves, this is quite[NL]
a valuable mirror.[A][NL]
It is a gift given only to clerics[NL]
of the highest order.[.][A][NL]

you to have one means your mother[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, she was a cleric[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

Here[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I've been asking around since[.][NL]
the last time we spoke.[.][A][NL]
I found out that our convoy master had[NL]
found a mirror lying on the ground.[.][A][NL]
When I asked to see it, imagine my[NL]
delight when I saw it was your mirror![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Sniff[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I'm so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
so happy![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
You know, when I was looking for[NL]
your mirror, I was reminded[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I had a similar experience when I was[.][NL]
young. It's why I chose to be a monk.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What happened?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]One day, when I was just a little boy,[NL]
I had lost a toy, and I was crying.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I lived near a monastery, and one of[NL]
the monks saw me sitting there weeping.[.][A][NL]
He spent his day trying to find out why[.][NL]
I was so sad and to cheer me up.[A][NL]
It was so trivial--that toy was nothing[.][NL]
but a trinket, but to me, it had value.[.][A][NL]
I later found out a friend of mine[NL]
had taken it without asking, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Anyway, I was very happy that someone[.][NL]
had stopped to show so much concern.[A][NL]
To everyone else, I was just a petty[NL]
child weeping over a toy.[.][A][NL]
To this monk, however, I was a sad and[NL]
lost soul, crying out in need.[A][NL]
He was so kind, and he spent so much[NL]
of his day on a child's tears.[A][NL]
I admired his attitude, even then.[A][NL]
It was then that I realized that I could[NL]
honor his deed by becoming a monk.[A][OpenMidLeft]And[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]that's why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, that's why.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Oh! Your mirror![A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]Here you go.[A][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

vast improvement on those tears.[A][NL]
The heavens themselves must have[NL]
wanted to see that smile[A][NL]
and conspired to help me find[.][NL]
your mirror.[A][OpenLeft]Thank you, Artur[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'm so grateful.[A][OpenRight]No, Neimi.[A][NL]
I'm grateful to you. Talking to you[.][NL]
makes me feel at peace.[.][A][NL]
I feel like[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]some of the others make[.][NL]
light of me from time to time.[A][OpenLeft]Oh, that's only[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] It's just because[NL]
you're so honest and pure of heart.[.][A][NL]
Someone I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]teases me a lot,[NL]
too. All the time, he teases me.[A][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry to hear that.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Well, it's not that he's all bad.[.][NL]
He can be very kind, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But you're kind, too, Artur.[A][OpenRight]Thank you.[A][NL]
You know, when you meet someone, that[.][NL]
person reflects back at you[.][A][NL]
like a mirror, revealing within them[NL]
the emotions that you project.[A][NL]
Angry people bring out the anger within[.][NL]
others, just as sullen, hopeless people[.][A][NL]
bring out nothing but the sorrow within[.][NL]
all those to whom they speak.[.][A][NL]
Do you know why so many people seem[.][NL]
kind to you, Neimi?[.][A][NL]
It is because you yourself are a kind[.][NL]
person. You bring that out in others.[.][A][OpenLeft]Oh, Artur[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] That's so kind--[.][NL]
I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Er[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Thank you.[.][A][OpenRight]Please, Neimi, always hold that[.][NL]
kindness close to your heart.[.][A][OpenLeft]I will[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

I was just observing this[.][NL]
chemida beetle.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You haven't changed at[NL]
all, have you, Lute?[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidRight]You spent most of your time sequestered[.][NL]
in your room, studying your books.[A][NL]
On the rare occasion you went outside,[NL]
you were paralyzed with fascination.[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course! There are so many fascinating[NL]
things to be learned from nature![.][A][NL]
There are a great many books out there,[.][NL]
and I have read most of them, of course.[A][NL]
But I've found that what is written can[.][NL]
differ greatly from how things truly are.[.][A][NL]
Take this chemida beetle, for example.[A][NL]
I've been reading from [0x93]The Glossary[NL]
of Falibrian Entomology[0x94] lately.[A][NL]
According to the glossary, their wings[NL]
fall off once they reach maturity.[A][NL]
However, I have just found an adult[.][NL]
beetle whose wings still work perfectly![A][NL]
Exceptions do exist to the rules my[.][NL]
books outline. This is a rare specimen.[.][A][NL]
I wonder, should we take it back with us?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I hope this isn't another[.][NL]
of your pranks.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]My[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]pranks?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Do you remember when I loaned[.][NL]
you my copy of [0x93]Lux Aeterna[0x94]?[.][A][NL]
You replaced my bookmark with[.][NL]
the tail of a sedgel lizard.[A][NL]
You scared ten years off my[.][NL]
life, I swear it![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Did I do that?[A][OpenMidRight]And! Knowing full well that I[.][NL]
have a[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]mild[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]fear of spiders,[A][NL]
you caught a small army of them[.][NL]
and unleashed them in my room![A][OpenMidLeft]I thought that if I immersed[NL]
you in the thing you feared,[A][NL]
maybe you might be able to[NL]
overcome your fear entirely![A][NL]
And I went to a lot of trouble[NL]
trying to catch those spiders![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Why would you do that?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I did get a bit of a kick[.][NL]
out of the experience myself.[.][A][NL]
Why? Did it bother you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]YES![.....] [.][ToggleSmile]Oh, don't worry about it.[.][A][NL]

In this day and age, we're fighting[.][NL]
monsters from the legends and epics?[A][NL]
I know how much is at stake, but[NL]
sometimes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I get so tired.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When you're tired, there's nothing better[.][NL]
than a good meal and a long sleep.[A][NL]
And if you look at page 990 of [0x93]De[NL]
Floris Mysticis,[0x94] there's a special[.][A][NL]
herb that, once decocted into a potion,[.][NL]
will help relax your muscles.[.][A][NL]
Look for the parfina flower, and reduce[.][NL]
it into a thick syrup before drinking.[A][NL]
Oh, and I hear music helps you sleep.[.][NL]
If you like, I can hum something for you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A][NL]
However, I think I'll pass on your offer,[.][NL]
delightful though your humming must be.[.][A][NL]
You must be tired as well. Take care[NL]
of yourself, and rest when you can.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I will.[.][A][NL]

hum to myself instead.[A][NL]

refreshed, in fact.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Refreshed?[.....] How so?[NL]
Was it some new kind of magic?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Perhaps, from a certain point of view.[A][NL]
Your every word has nurtured my soul[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hm.[.][A][NL]

Oh, the name is Artur.[A][OpenMidLeft]I'm Cormag.[.][NL]
Nice to meet you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You, too, Sir Cormag.[.][NL]
It's a pleasure.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Interested in wyverns, are you?[A][OpenMidRight]It's not so much interest as it is,[.][NL]
well, fascination, if you will.[.][A][NL]
The way how they fly in the sky at will[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
and their powerful limbs.[.][A][NL]
I've seen them from a distance before,[NL]

Do you think it would mind if[.][NL]
I were to touch it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Nah, go right ahead.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]But wyverns can be proud. They won't[NL]
warm up to anyone they think unworthy.[A][NL]
Took me three years before this one[.][NL]
would let me ride on his back.[A][NL]
Oh, he hated me at first. Always[NL]
snarling and snatching at me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1A][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Sir Cormag![.][A][OpenMidRight]If it isn't Artur.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]What's the rush?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I've been thinking about how to[.][NL]
become friends with Genarog.[A][NL]
I was thinking perhaps he might[.][NL]
like it if I gave him something.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You want to give Genarog a gift?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Yes. It's an amulet made of a star stone.[.][A][NL]
According to legend, those who carry[NL]
star stones are blessed from above.[.][A][NL]
It's customary to wear them as amulets[NL]
in Renais, and I thought[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] But that's your amulet,[NL]
isn't it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No need to worry for me, Sir Cormag.[NL]
I pray every morning and every night.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, if that's the case, then we'll[NL]
take it. Look at that, Genarog![.][A][NL]
All right, Artur, I want you to[.][NL]
place it in his saddlebag.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm a little scared, but[NL]
[ToggleSmile]I'll give it a try![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]All right[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] The saddlebag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
This one right here?[A][NL]
[.......]There you go[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Sir Cormag, look! Genarog[.][NL]
licked my hand![.][A][OpenMidRight]Whoa, not bad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Not bad at all, Artur.[A][NL]
I've never once seen him[NL]
lick anyone's hand but mine.[A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yeah, and it took him two years[.][NL]
before he'd even do that![.][A][NL]
You and he seem to be getting[.][NL]
along famously, as they say.[A][OpenLeft]That makes me happy, Sir Cormag.[NL]
I'm glad he likes the amulet.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I think he likes you more than[NL]
he likes that amulet, honestly.[.][A][OpenLeft]Really, Sir Cormag?[.][NL]
May I talk to him again?[A][OpenMidRight]Sure, anytime. We're looking[NL]
forward to it. Both of us.[A][X]

# 0x0CE2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1A][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13][0x01][OpenMidRight]I should apologize to[.][NL]
you, Artur.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What's wrong, Sir Cormag?[.][NL]
Did something happen?[.][A][OpenMidRight]The star-stone amulet that you[NL]
so generously gave Genarog[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It got shattered when an[NL]
archer attacked us.[.][A][NL]
It's not all bad, though. That[NL]
stone stopped the arrow cold.[.][A][NL]
Saved both me AND Genarog, it did.[A][NL]
Had that amulet been not there,[.][NL]
we wouldn't be here right now.[A][OpenMidLeft]That's unfortunate, but[.][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad the amulet worked![.][A][NL]
I'll have to make a prayer of[.][NL]
thanks for the stone's protection.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, we owe you, Artur.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]And it's not exactly a[NL]
perfect trade, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Here.[A][OpenMidLeft]What's this?[A][NL]
[CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][......][OpenLeft]This[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] This looks like[NL]
a wyvern stone![.][A][OpenMidRight]A wyvern stone? Are they rare?[A][OpenLeft]Yes, very! Where on earth[.][NL]
did you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Genarog had it.[.][A][NL]
I didn't have any idea what it was.[.][A][NL]
I figured maybe you'd know something[NL]
about it.[.][A][NL]
And it looks like I was right,[NL]
wasn't I? You know what it's worth?[.][A][NL]
Well, like I said, it's yours.[NL]
Keep it.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]A-are you sure!?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Sure. You don't mind, now,[NL]
do you, Genarog?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]Th-thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I mean it[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Sir Cormag, Genarog[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Wyvern stones are like dragonstones,[NL]
only far more rare. Mages covet them.[.][A][NL]
Having one focuses your powers,[.][NL]
refines your magical control.[.][A][NL]
But nobody knows where they come[NL]
from or how to craft them.[A][NL]
There are no more than a handful of[.][NL]
wyvern stones in the world today.[.][A][NL]
I never thought I'd even see one,[.][NL]
much less hold one in my hands.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]So it's a big deal, eh?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft]It most certainly is, Sir Cormag.[.][NL]
Genarog[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I can't thank you enough.[A][NL]
You've made one of my dreams[NL]
come true.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm glad we were able to[NL]
help you, Artur.[A][OpenLeft]I'll cherish this wyvern stone always.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][......][ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]By the way, Sir Cormag,[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]do you have a dream?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]My dream. Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][NL]
My only dream right now is to undo[NL]
the damage Grado has done.[A][NL]
I want Grado to be a peaceful nation[NL]
again, ruled by a gentle man.[.][A][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure you'll see your own[NL]
dream realized, Sir Cormag.[.][A][NL]
After all, we're all fighting[.][NL]
to make that dream come true.[.][A][NL]
You and Genarog have made my[NL]
own dream a reality.[A][NL]
And you know that I'll do what[NL]
I can to make yours real, too.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Genarog was right. You are[NL]
a good lad, Artur.[A][NL]
Tell you what. If we do restore[.][NL]
peace, you must visit my homeland.[A][NL]
And when you do, I think Genarog[NL]
would like to take you flying.[A][OpenLeft]I'd love to, Sir Cormag. I look forward[.][NL]
to visiting Grado in better times.[A][X]

I don't really need to polish my[NL]

It's easier than losing[.][NL]
another bet to you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean? You've[NL]

Out of the past 21 coin flips,[NL]

Or is there a bounty on my head?[A][NL]
Or is this perhaps a private matter?[A][OpenMidRight]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]guess it would be that last one.[NL]
I have a favor to ask.[A][OpenMidLeft]What would it be?[.][A][NL]

seven categories and 25 items.[A][OpenMidRight]I don't know how it would be classified,[NL]
but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I want you to help us fight.[A][OpenMidLeft]Why?[A][OpenMidRight]I'm a strong believer that morale is[NL]
best served by good leadership.[.][A][NL]
A unit of knights, all trained[NL]
by Renais's finest generals.[A][NL]
But we're fighting no ordinary foe,[.][NL]
and we need more diverse skills.[A][NL]
That's where you come in.[.][A][NL]
Because you can use magic, you[NL]
could be invaluable in helping me[.][A][NL]
develop unique battle strategies.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]So that's what you wanted[.][NL]
me for, is it?[A][OpenMidRight]How about it? Would you do it?[A][OpenMidLeft]Sure. Anything you say.[.][NL]
I don't mind.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I should warn you, I spend my[.][NL]
time on the front line.[.][A][NL]
I ride out to meet the enemy head-[NL]
on rather than attacking from afar.[.][A][NL]
It's a much riskier prospect than[.][NL]
supporting from the rear guard.[.][A][NL]
Is that going to be a problem?[A][OpenMidLeft]I have no objections.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Excellent! I appreciate your help.[A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x29][0x01][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Our researches ended in[.][NL]
miserable failure.[A][NL]
Grado's Sacred Stone was shattered.[.][NL]
Prince Lyon, corrupted[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
And this whole tragedy that unfolds[.][NL]
around us even now.[.][A][NL]
It's true. We mages have triggered[NL]
this age's greatest calamity.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But why? What was it all for?[.][A][NL]
What did you hope to accomplish[.][NL]
with the power of the Sacred Stone?[.][A][OpenMidRight]All Prince Lyon wanted was to help[NL]
people[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and we are his servants.[A][OpenMidLeft]Help people?[A][OpenMidRight]We read of a spell entitled the time shear.[.][NL]
It causes, in effect, a hole in time.[.][A][NL]
This spell warps time, punches a[NL]
hole through cause and effect.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We lack the knowledge to reproduce[NL]
this ancient spell today.[.][A][NL]
Prince Lyon, however, was convinced[.][NL]
that we could unravel its secret.[.][A][NL]
He felt we could use it to predict--[NL]
and even prevent--future events.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Prevent[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]the future?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh, we dedicated years to studying[NL]
this spell.[.][A][NL]
You see, the greater the disaster, the[NL]
farther it sends ripples through time.[A][NL]
We learned to read these ripples from[.][NL]
the future, hoping to save lives.[.][A][NL]
If we could know when a disaster would[NL]
strike, we could evacuate people.[.][A][NL]
We could save millions of lives.[A][OpenMidLeft]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][A][NL]
It seems so, so blasphemous.[A][NL]
That worldly creatures should[.][NL]
take control of fate, it--[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight]Are you saying that, knowing the[NL]
future, we should do nothing?[.][A][NL]
We should simply allow people to[NL]
die in order to preserve [0x93]fate[0x94]?[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry. I don't mean to[NL]
sound hostile.[A][NL]
Prince Lyon himself was troubled[NL]
by these same doubts, you see.[A][NL]
But we pressed on with our studies.[.][A][NL]
We felt it was our duty, in the[.][NL]
interest of all Grado's people.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Perhaps we were bitter that we[NL]
receive no credit for aiding Grado.[.][A][NL]
That we receive no accolades for our[NL]
research, for the benefit it brings.[A][NL]
I do not know. But we pressed on,[.][NL]
nonetheless.[A][NL]
The misconceptions linking the ancient[NL]
magics to [0x93]evil[0x94] die hard and slow.[.][A][NL]
Prince Lyon sought to change that.[A][NL]
He wanted, as we all wanted, to[.][NL]
prove that our magic had good uses.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Prince Lyon would never--[.][A][OpenMidRight]With our aid, Prince Lyon predicted[.][NL]
a great storm rising in the south.[A][NL]
He barred ships from leaving port,[NL]
and, oh, how the people complained.[.][A][NL]
But the storm came, and the seas[NL]
raged. We saved countless lives.[A][NL]
And Prince Lyon cared not at all[NL]
if the people loved him for it.[.][A][NL]
He only wanted them to be safe.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And now, I see it all so clearly.[.][NL]
All our research amounts to nothing.[A][NL]
All I can do now is lament our[NL]
hunger for knowledge. Our greed.[A][X]

Some tremendous disaster to come?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]And in knowing about the disaster,[NL]

knowledge blasphemous?[A][OpenMidLeft]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]don't know what to do.[A][NL]

he might be able to guide me.[.][A][NL]

burn in the earth's hot blood.[A][NL]

This is what we have foreseen.[A][OpenMidLeft]How-- How can this--[A][OpenMidRight]I advise you to leave Grado.[A][NL]
You might be able to escape the disaster[NL]
if you head north to Renais or Frelia.[A][OpenMidLeft]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I can't do that.[A][NL]
When this disaster strikes, people[NL]
will need help and healing.[.][A][NL]
If I could help them even a little[NL]
by staying behind[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]You would willingly risk certain[NL]
death to save a handful of people?[A][OpenMidLeft]If I died serving Grado, I would[NL]
have no regrets, Master Knoll.[A][NL]

make the most of this knowledge.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
Spoken like a true cleric.[A][NL]
You would drop everything without[.][NL]
hesitation just to help others.[.][A][NL]

you when the time comes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Master Knoll?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If I am to honor Prince Lyon's[NL]

Ever since this started, we've been[.][NL]
fighting nothing but Grado soldiers.[A][NL]
These are our countrymen.[.][NL]
Our families[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Every battle we win, I see only how[.][NL]
many casualties we've caused.[.][A][NL]
I'm a healer, but to win this, I[NL]
must turn my back on my countrymen.[.][A][NL]
I have to let them suffer, when[.][NL]
all I want to do is help them.[A][NL]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]But what?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Grado is responsible for all of[.][NL]
this. Our homeland[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Grado has caused so many deaths now.[NL]
We have no choice but to fight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah. You see it now. That's the[NL]
sad irony of the battlefield.[.][A][NL]
I ride a wyvern and use my spear to[.][NL]
bring low men who should be my allies.[A][NL]
We each joined this cause in hopes of[.][NL]
bringing Grado to its senses.[.][A][NL]
Our country has set the world on its[NL]
ear, and it's up to us to right things.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I suppose[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
You know something, Natasha?[A][NL]
You should never be ashamed of[NL]
the fact that you're from Grado.[A][NL]
You have no debt to pay, no burden[NL]
of guilt to bear.[.][A][NL]
Grado was once a magnificent country.[.][NL]
Do what you can to restore that glory.[A][NL]

Grado down the wrong path,[A][NL]

can set things right again.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I understand, Cormag. I'll do what[NL]

lifted from my heart. Thank you.[A][OpenMidRight]Ah, I just wanted to see that lovely[NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x2A][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x22][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Hi, there.[A][OpenMidRight]Hello, Joshua.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Do you have a few minutes to spare?[.][NL]
I wanted to win back my money.[A][NL]
You were doing pretty well the[NL]
other day. I was overconfident.[.][A][NL]
But today, I'm feeling lucky.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I accept your proposal.[.][A][NL]
But remember, I think that gambling[.][NL]
is an immoral, inexcusable pastime.[.][A][NL]
You can tell it is wicked, because[NL]
of how good you feel when you win.[A][OpenMidLeft]Can't disagree with you there.[A][NL]
Last time, I went easy on you[.][NL]
because you were an amateur.[A][NL]
Don't think I'm gonna throw[.][NL]
away my money like that today.[A][OpenMidRight]I would never ask you to go easy[NL]
on me, Joshua.[A][NL]
After all, I have righteousness at[NL]
my side, and I need no favors.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Righteousness? Is that[NL]
what you've got?[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]And to think, you were the one[NL]
telling me gambling was wrong![A][OpenMidRight]Oh, but it is wrong. I meant to teach you[.][NL]
a lesson, and your lesson continues.[A][NL]
When done for a just cause, surely[NL]
gambling could not possibly be wrong.[.][A][NL]
Now, let's see the color of[.][NL]
your money![.][A][X]

You got me. I lost.[.][NL]
I've had enough.[A][NL]

Where's your spirit?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Man. I just don't get it.[.][NL]

divine powers on your side.[.][A][NL]

You don't know anything, and you[NL]
STILL managed to beat me![.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]What do you mean, I don't know[NL]
anything? Oh! Such disrespect![A][NL]
What do you know, other than[NL]
gambling? Tell me that![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm? Let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I know how to survive in[NL]
a desert, for one thing.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I think we're all quite familiar[NL]
with the hardships of travel by now![A][NL]
If that's all you've got, don't go[NL]
around telling me I'M the ignorant one![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Aaaah! Enough already! Fine! Fine![NL]
I was wrong!!![A][NL]
Anyway, the point is that I'm not[.][NL]
gambling with you ANYMORE![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight]Oh! He ran away![NL]

way, you ever hear this?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hear what?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I guess it was popular for[NL]
a while, way back when.[.][A][NL]
But when two swordsmen met on the[.][NL]
battlefield--even allied swordsmen--[A][NL]
they would duel it out to test one[NL]
another's worth with the blade.[.][A][NL]
So what do you say? Don't you think[.][NL]
it's time to revive this tradition?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
You want me to kill you?[A][OpenMidRight]No, no, no. I'm not saying we have[NL]
to fight to the death![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]It's just a simple test of skill.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Fine. As long as I get a chance[.][NL]
to whet my blade's appetite.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Great! Now, what say we[NL]

not going to lose to you.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Now you're talking.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Then let's get started.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Whoa! Hold your horses! Where's the[.][NL]
hurry? Let's do this another day.[.][A][NL]
After all, I like to savor the[NL]
anticipation a little bit.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I don't get it,[.][NL]
but fine.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Great! We're all set then.[A][NL]
Next time we meet, we[.][NL]
cross swords. Deal?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
There's nothing to anticipate.[NL]
You're simply going to lose.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, I don't know about that.[A][NL]

But remember, I was at a slight[.][NL]
disadvantage, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I must admit, I did hold you at[.][NL]
a slight disadvantage.[A][NL]
However, we are closely matched,[NL]
despite our incompatible styles.[A][NL]
I simply couldn't land a decisive[.][NL]
blow. But it was all worthwhile.[A][NL]
After all, I've learned, and that[.][NL]
is worth far more than any wager.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I see.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]You're a quick one, aren't you?[.][A][NL]
How did you get that good?[A][OpenMidRight]Fighting is all I have.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You live for the sword, eh?[.][A][NL]

on gambling, right?[.][A][NL]
Let me see[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] There's not[NL]
much to tell.[.][A][NL]
I guess by the time I realized it,[NL]
[ToggleSmile]it was already too late.[A][NL]
I'd grown bored of everything[.][NL]
before I discovered gambling.[.][A][NL]
But then I saw it--gambling was[.][NL]
like life, in short little bursts.[A][NL]
Life itself is just one big gamble![.][NL]
[ToggleSmile]That's how I see things.[A][OpenMidRight]I see.[NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I don't know anything about[.][NL]
gambling, but it was a good duel.[.][A][NL]

doesn't sound very fun.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Suit yourself.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You mean that? Then we'll[.][NL]

for training. And gambling.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]So, nothing would change[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, I suppose, but there's still[NL]
a point to it all.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What's that?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If I train with you, I'm going[NL]
to become a better swordsman.[.][A][NL]

we'll each learn something.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I could ask nothing better.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]And there's something that I want to[NL]
do soon when the war is over.[.][A][NL]
It's something that can't be done[.][NL]
in a single day or overnight.[.][A][NL]
You could probably call this the[NL]

want to use luck as an excuse.[A][NL]
Don't blame luck if you lose a[NL]
fight. Blame yourself, but not luck.[A][NL]
Renais didn't fall because of bad[.][NL]
fortune. It was malice that did it.[.][A][NL]
You're right--there's good luck and[.][NL]
bad, but it's no excuse for failure.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that's a good point[.][NL]
you've got there.[.][A][NL]

believing in my luck for now.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Whatever works for you.[.][A][NL]

We're lucky you're on our side.[.][A][OpenMidRight]That's the best compliment[NL]
a mercenary can get.[A][OpenMidLeft]Call it a hunch, but I think this is[NL]
the start of a long friendship.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You think so, huh?[A][NL]

You're really ruining my nap.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You have no sense of self-preservation,[.][NL]

When you were a baby, you were planning[.][NL]
out strategies to take over the nursery.[A][NL]
You were stuck up then, and you're stuck[NL]
up now. And STILL the ladies liked you![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You leave them out of this![.][NL]
Women have nothing to do with it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]They don't? Oh, come on![A][NL]
Isn't it important to have an heir to[.][NL]
carry your standard when you're gone?[.][A][NL]
Take your sister, Mia--she married[NL]
into a nice Frelian family, didn't she?[.][A][NL]
I'm just curious who would ever settle[NL]
for such an uptight knight as you.[A][NL]
You ever think about that? You think[NL]
you might meet her in this war?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's not what I'm here for![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha ha. Of course not. But I[.][NL]
bet you're still a ladies' man, huh?[A][NL]
I know you--you're a perfect gentlemen,[.][NL]
always nice to the ladies.[A][NL]
I remember when you were little, you[NL]

you saw a little girl crying. You[.][NL]

that you would do that. It was cool.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I just could never turn my back[.][NL]

lost in thought for a moment.[.][A][NL]
I figured that I could use a[NL]
little breathing room.[A][NL]
I guess that's why you paint[NL]
your landscapes, isn't it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's right. You see it now?[.][A][NL]
Everyone needs a little space to[NL]
think, even on the battlefield.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Well, I wouldn't go so far as to[NL]
approve of painting during a battle.[A][NL]
What if the younger soldiers started[NL]
to copy your example?[.][A][NL]
However, I see your point. Everyone[.][NL]

doing those drawings, anyway?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What's the matter? Forgotten[NL]
when you started?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I started drawing and painting[NL]
when my mother died.[A][OpenMidRight]Really?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When I was young, I won a tournament[NL]
for training swordsmen[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I remember that.[NL]
I took second place.[A][OpenMidLeft]She seemed far more pleased at a picture[NL]
I'd drawn of her than at my victory.[A][NL]
She kept that picture near her always,[NL]
and she looked at it often.[.][A][NL]
She rejoiced more in my skill with the[NL]
brush than in my skill with the sword.[A][NL]
I never understood why[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Not until[NL]
recently, at any rate.[A][OpenMidRight]Your mother was very kind.[NL]
I remember that about her.[A][NL]
I'm sorry that she fell ill[.][NL]
while you were so young.[A][OpenMidLeft]I feel lucky--I have my memories[NL]
of her, after all.[A][NL]
Franz, though[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] He was too little[NL]
to talk or even walk.[.][A][NL]
That's why I kept that picture of[.][NL]
her hanging in our home.[A][OpenMidRight]So that's the story behind that[.][NL]
picture in your house[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I didn't realize you drew it.[.][A][NL]
I remember watching you practice[NL]
swordplay when we were little.[A][NL]
I wanted to be like you, and I was[NL]
irritated that I didn't practice more.[A][NL]
I got so upset with myself when I lost[NL]
the tournament to you.[A][NL]
That's why I work so hard to keep[.][NL]
practicing and improving my skills.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I didn't know[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, man. It's not like me to get[NL]
this introspective.[.][A][NL]
What is it about you that makes me[NL]

Come on, let's go.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Heh. All right.[.][A][NL]
Oh, and, Forde[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][A][OpenMidRight]When this whole war is over,[NL]

I was on a special mission to[.][NL]

for that? It was so long ago![.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] You're right,[NL]
you're right.[.][A][NL]

I grew up in landlocked Renais. I'd[.][NL]
never seen the ocean.[.][A][NL]
Not before you showed it to me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You didn't show any interest at[.][NL]
all in local culture or cuisine.[A][NL]
But when I asked if you'd like to[.][NL]
go to the sea, you got so excited![A][OpenMidLeft]It was intense. I felt so small,[NL]

outnumbered. Badly.[.][A][NL]
When they saw I was a knight, they[NL]
wasted no time surrounding me.[A][NL]

then, out of nowhere, you show up.[A][NL]

remember! [0x93]Don't be a hero[0x94] indeed![.][A][OpenMidLeft]You'd left Frelia before I could give[.][NL]

How could I possibly misplace it?[.][NL]
I carry it with me as a reminder.[.][A][NL]
As long as I have this, I feel like I'll[NL]
always have someone watching over me.[.][A][NL]
Actually, I started collecting wooden[.][NL]

for archers and warn one another.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hm. Yes, you've got a good idea[.][NL]
there. A [0x93]buddy system[0x94] of sorts.[.][A][NL]
But if you saw an ally in danger, you'd[.][NL]
warn him regardless, wouldn't you?[A][OpenMidLeft]Well, of course! But we're so high[NL]
up that I was worried[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
If I saw an archer, I didn't think[NL]
my voice would carry to you in time.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps the neighing of a pegasus or[NL]
the cries of a wyvern could carry[.][A][NL]
far enough to warn the others.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh! I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] Yes, we might not be able[NL]
to hear each other in the heat of battle.[.][A][NL]
But our steeds can be louder than[.][NL]
either of us could.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]And trust me, my wyvern's shriek can[NL]
pierce your ear from two leagues away.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]A brilliant idea, Your Highness.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][NL]
Thank you.[A][OpenMidRight]Right, so if we see anything out there,[.][NL]
we'll have our mounts call out, right?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, and thank you, Cormag.[.][A][X]

that archer the other day.[A][NL]
Your wyvern startled me, but I think[NL]
you may have saved my life![.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, you should thank him, then.[.][NL]
I can't take credit for it.[.][A][NL]
I mean, he started shrieking out to[.][NL]
you before I even saw that bowman.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Really?[.][....][NL]
That's amazing[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]In that case[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseSpeechSlow][.....][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][.....]Thank you.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]The bond between a wyvern and rider[.][NL]
is close, and this guy's a smart one.[.][A][NL]
I'm sure you and your pegasus[.][NL]
are the same, wouldn't you say?[.][A][OpenLeft]Oh, yes. It's the same with every[.][NL]
knight and her pegasus.[.][A][NL]
It's so sad to see how war has changed[NL]
the way we relate to our animal allies.[.][A][NL]
It's taking such a tremendous toll[NL]
on these beautiful creatures.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I agree. This whole war is ludicrous.[.][A][NL]
War itself is madness, even more so if[NL]
it's for greed or the fantasy of power.[.][A][OpenLeft]I hope our efforts end this war quickly.[NL]
I don't want to see anyone else die.[A][OpenMidRight]Nor do I. But you cannot race[.][NL]
headlong into battle.[.][A][NL]
We'll need you to help rebuild[NL]
our shattered nations, after all.[.][A][NL]
We soldiers are expendable, but[.][NL]
you regal types aren't.[.][A][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Cormag, don't say that![.][A][OpenMidRight]But it's true.[A][OpenLeft]No! No life is expendable![A][OpenMidRight]Your Highness[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenLeft]Don't throw your life away.[.][NL]

and for some reason, it made me sad.[A][OpenMidRight]I see. I can think of many reasons[NL]
why a man would fight.[A][NL]
Atonement, revenge, entertainment[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

I am fighting anymore.[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidLeft]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What more would you expect from a[.][NL]

A man whose emperor has gone mad,[.][NL]
whose homeland is collapsing?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
What are you going to do[NL]
when the war is over?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I'll help rebuild Grado, of course,[.][NL]
but I'm not sure beyond that.[.][A][NL]
I doubt that I'll remain in Grado[.][NL]
for long, though.[.][A][NL]
They've branded me a traitor. I'll[NL]
find no home awaiting me there.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then why don't you come to Frelia?[NL]
You can join us as an airborne knight![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And what makes you think a traitor[NL]
like me would be welcomed in Frelia?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You're no traitor, Cormag. You've[.][NL]
stayed true to your beliefs.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]That sadness I saw in you comes from your[.][NL]
own country's betrayal of those beliefs.[A][NL]
Your sadness runs as deep as your[.][NL]
faith in Grado once ran.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I want your faith, your strength, and[.][NL]
your passion to serve Frelia now.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I appreciate the offer, but I cannot[NL]
reforge the oaths I've broken.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sorry.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It's all right.[.][.....][NL]
I understand your feelings.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]However, if you ever wish to serve[NL]
your beliefs again, remember my offer.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I might just give up this soldiering[NL]
nonsense and go into woodworking.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Then I'll track you down in[.][NL]
your woodshop and ask again.[A][OpenMidRight]You may not look it, but you're[.][NL]

However, I still insist that you[NL]

It was a twist of fate that started[.][NL]
me on this path[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Really? But I've heard of your fame[.][NL]
from no less a person than my father.[.][A][NL]

doing what I had to.[A][NL]

you with these mercenaries?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ahh[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]The answer is so simple,[NL]
you'll probably laugh.[A][NL]
Back when I was a kid, a friend from my[.][NL]
village said he wanted to be a mercenary.[.][A][NL]
He said he was going to be famous, the[NL]
greatest warrior in all the land.[.][A][NL]
No matter how many times I told him to[NL]
give it up, he wouldn't listen to me.[.][A][NL]
Well, one day, he left for Jehanna.[.][A][NL]
I didn't know what else to do, so I went[NL]
with him and joined the guild, too.[.][A][NL]
Stupid reason, isn't it? Anyway[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I didn't particularly like fighting, and[NL]
while I wasn't opposed to the money,[A][NL]
I certainly wasn't in it for fame[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I just couldn't let my friend go off[NL]

continue being a mercenary[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But then there were other men who I[.][NL]
considered to be my friends.[A][NL]
I couldn't bring myself to abandon them[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
And so the years passed and here I am.[A][NL]
The thing is I can't stand to see my [.][NL]
friends die.[A][NL]
But if you're in this business long enough,[.][NL]
people around you get killed. It happens.[.][A][NL]
The only thing you can do is keep moving[NL]
forward and try not to think about it.[A][NL]

to be true[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Those born to royalty cannot show[.][NL]
others any weaknesses or deficiencies.[A][NL]
If they're not perfect at all times, their[NL]
enemies will take advantage of them.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah? So?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But meeting you has made me rethink[.][NL]
that belief.[A][NL]
My father told me before I left that[NL]
I should watch you and learn from you.[A][NL]
At the time, I believed there was[.][NL]
nothing a mercenary could teach me.[.][A][NL]
Now I know better. I am thankful to both[NL]
my father and you.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's enough of that. In my opinion,[.][NL]
you're much finer than I could ever be.[.][A][NL]
The way you live, your manners, and your[NL]
bearing[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove] I could never pull it off.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Me? What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Look at you! You're full of confidence.[.][NL]
You've got pride.[.][A][NL]
When I first met you, I thought,[NL]
[0x93]What a high-handed dandy.[0x94] [A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Did you just call me[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]a dandy?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But that's just who you are.[A][NL]
Being proud is not always[.][NL]
a bad thing.[A][NL]
You must have worked yourself near to[.][NL]
death to preserve that pride.[.][A][NL]
What I mean is that you never make[NL]
excuses for losing or being beaten up.[A][NL]
No matter the pain you face or hardship, [.][NL]
you keep on fighting to honor that pride.[.][A][NL]
It's what defines you, and I can't[NL]
say that I don't admire it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]It comes naturally.[.][A][NL]
I will be king one day, and I will make[.][NL]
Frelia the greatest nation in all the world.[A][NL]
It will be a wonderful kingdom of wealth [.][NL]
and power.[A][NL]
When that day comes, I will command you[.][NL]
to become general and lead Frelia's armies.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]No, I'll have you come and ask me to[NL]
make you general.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ha ha ha! I can't wait![.][A][ToggleSmile][X]

our first chance to speak privately.[A][NL]
I am L'Arachel of the Theocracy of Rausten.[.][NL]
It's a pleasure to meet you.[A][OpenMidLeft]I believe you already know my name.[.][A][NL]
I am Innes, prince of Frelia.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Speaking of Frelia[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Oh, I remember,[.][NL]
the seafood was delicious there.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes. I would agree that the fish of[.][NL]
my homeland is not unpleasant.[A][OpenMidRight]Yes.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]However it does not compare with[NL]
that of my home, Rausten.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Is that so?[.][A][NL]
I know not what fish your country[.][NL]
has to offer, but I have a hard time[A][NL]
imagining they could be that much[.][NL]
tastier than our own.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Your doubt is not surprising.[.][A][NL]
Once this war is over, you must[.][NL]
come and visit Rausten.[.][A][NL]
I think it best if you try a wide[.][NL]
variety of our fish for yourself.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]That's a good idea.[.][NL]
I will most certainly do so.[A][NL]
And perhaps you have not tasted[.][NL]
all the fish Frelia has to offer.[.][A][NL]
To be sure, you should visit again.[.][NL]
Perhaps a culinary exchange is in order.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]It may be you change your opinion.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]We'll see.[......][NL]
Very well, I accept your invitation.[A][NL]
I will visit your country once more[.][NL]
and taste your national dishes.[.][A][X]

to be here?[.][A][NL]
I wonder if you're truly here with the[NL]
permission of your superiors.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Of-of course I am![A][NL]
What gives you the right to speak[.][NL]
to me in such a manner?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, I have heard a bit about[NL]
your wild behavior[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]H-how rude you are![.][A][NL]
If I were not a holy woman, I[.][NL]
would beat you senseless.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]How savage YOU are.[.][A][NL]
Perhaps you could learn self-control by[.][NL]
observing Frelia's pegasus knights.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Yes, there's something I'd like to show you.[A][NL]
When the Frelia's pegasi gather[.][NL]
in Walles Forest[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It's a spectacle of such beauty[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]If it is beauty you seek, then[NL]
Rausten is second to none.[A][NL]
Do you know of Rausten's lofty[NL]
peak Mount Mimir.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I pity those who die without having[.][NL]
gazed upon its breathtaking beauty.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
If you recommend it so highly, then[.][NL]
yes, I would indeed like to see it.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes. That would be splendid[.][NL]
indeed.[.][A][NL]
But there are many more equally[.][NL]
beautiful places in Rausten.[A][OpenMidLeft]Then perhaps you should tell me[.][NL]
about them for future reference.[A][NL]
And in return, I shall take time to tell you[NL]
about the beautiful places in my kingdom.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes, I would love to hear more.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x0F][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x22][0x01][OpenMidLeft]The Theocracy of Rausten certainly[NL]
sounds like a spectacular land.[.][A][OpenMidRight]As does Frelia, much more[.][NL]
than I imagined it would.[.][A][NL]
And yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]You mean to ask which is the[NL]
more spectacular? Is that it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What? That's no question at all![NL]
Rausten is clearly superior in every way.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I expected you would say so.[A][NL]
But what of the truth?[NL]
Your opinion is subjective, is it not?[A][OpenMidRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
All opinions are subjective,[A][NL]
but I'm sure an objective evaluation[NL]
would yield the same result.[A][OpenMidLeft]To prove that, we will need some[NL]
fair and impartial third in our discussion.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Indeed! And I have[NL]
a splendid idea.[A][NL]
Let the pair from Renais judge.[.][A][NL]
Surely Ephraim and Eirika can come to[.][NL]
a proper decision.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Of course. I agree completely.[A][NL]
I think I should remind the two of all[NL]
the wonder Frelia holds.[A][OpenMidRight]Then it's decided.[A][NL]
They will visit both of our homes, and[NL]
we'll show them such splendor as to[.][A][NL]
leave them breathless.[A][NL]
Invitations to tour our two nations[.][NL]
will surely have them overjoyed.[A][OpenMidLeft]It would only be natural.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It would be natural.[A][NL]
Very well then. Let us deal with this[.][NL]
evil and take those two home with us.[.][A][NL]
First and foremost, it is a competition[.][NL]
to see whose land is more magnificent![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I can see this whole affair has[.][NL]
you very enthralled.[A][NL]
I cannot say where this little[NL]
competition will lead us[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]But I am more than happy to go[NL]
up against you.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't blame me if you regret[NL]
our contest later, though.[A][NL]
You may be composed before others, but[NL]
you'll surely be lonely on your own.[A][OpenMidLeft]Be warned yourself. Your words here may[.][NL]
prove embarrassing to you later.[A][OpenMidRight]It's not a problem.[.][A][NL]

How are you feeling?[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, Chief. Things are as fine[.][NL]
as one could expect.[A][NL]
But I've been dancing so much[.][NL]
I've worked up quite a sweat.[.][A][NL]
At this rate I may even lose a few[NL]
inches off of my waistline.[.][A][NL]
Who knows, maybe my figure will be[NL]
even more alluring than before.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha! Well, I'm not sure that's even[NL]
possible, but keep up the good work.[A][NL]
Your dancing has had quite a restorative [.][NL]

must keep dancing then, mustn't I?[A][0x02][NL]
Oh, I almost forgot, Chief.[.][A][NL]

better news.[A][OpenMidRight]What's the good news?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I hear today's meal is one of[.][NL]
your favorites, herbed stew.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh, that is good news! It's been quite[NL]
a while since I've had any.[.][A][NL]
And the even better news?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]In this next battle, you'll get your hands[NL]

might be, but I can't wait for it.[A][NL]
Nor for today's meal.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm going to continue dancing a bit longer[NL]
so as to work up a healthy appetite.[A][OpenMidRight]So tell me, Tethys, when did[NL]
you first start dancing?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

What's the matter?[A][OpenMidLeft]Um, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Yes, it was long ago.[.][NL]
Back when Ewan was still young.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]What is it, Tethys?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I'm sorry, Chief. I'll explain  it [.][NL]
another time. Can we drop it for now?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

# 0x0D1A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1C][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1B][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Chief.[A][NL]
The truth is, Ewan and I? We were[.][NL]
abandoned by our parents.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
Oh, I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I wandered about with little Ewan in tow.[.][NL]
He had no idea what was happening.[A][NL]
I was a child myself with no job.[.][A][NL]
We went to bed hungry every night,[NL]
and our clothes were rags[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Then one day I said to myself,[NL]
[0x93]We cannot go on like this![0x94][A][NL]
I watched a dancer on a street corner[.][NL]
and memorized all of her moves.[.][A][NL]
I wasn't a very coordinated child and[.][NL]
it was so difficult.[A][NL]
I didn't have real shoes, so my feet[NL]
were a mess of blisters,[A][NL]
and I fell so many times I was covered[NL]
in cuts and bruises.[A][NL]
It was painful. And miserable. And[NL]
very, very difficult. But I never cried.[A][NL]
Because if were to cry, he would cry.[.][NL]
And I loved seeing Ewan's smiling face.[.][A][NL]
I wanted him to smile all the time,[.][NL]
so I worked hard so he could.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Tee hee hee. What a sad and[.][NL]
miserable tale. I'm sorry.[A][NL]
I was reminded of it all just recently,[.][NL]
and I was overcome with emotion[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But that's how I earned the dancing skills[NL]
and physique I have now![A][NL]
All of the hard work I did back then [.][NL]
has made me the woman I am today.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][Wink][.....][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][NL]
[ToggleSmile]What do you say to that?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I'm not sure what to say.[.][A][NL]
So before you met up with us, the two of you[NL]
had a rough time of it, did you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]OK, that's enough. The past is the past![NL]
You mustn't tell anyone about this.[.][A][NL]
I don't share this story with others.[.][NL]
I only told you because you're the chief.[.][A][NL]
A story of toil and hardship doesn't quite [.][NL]
fit my mysterious image, does it?[.][A][0x02][NL]
You know what I'd like?[.][.....][NL]
For you to tell me more about you.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Sure. Another time, though, OK?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]All right. Let's see this[.][NL]
thing through to the end.[.][A][NL]
If we do our best, good things will come[NL]
of it. And then better things after that.[.][A][NL]
Right, Chief?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Right, Tethys. You be careful.[A][OpenMidLeft]Of course! And you too, Chief![A][X]

# 0x0D1B
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1B][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1C][0x01][OpenMidRight]Um, Chief, there's actually one[.][NL]
thing I've been wanting to ask you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And what's that?[A][OpenMidRight]Sorry if this brings up any bad memories, but[.][NL]
how'd you get that scar on your face?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This?[.][A][NL]
I got this beauty when I had[NL]
just started out as a mercenary.[A][0x02][NL]
I was still a novice, but I was feeling[.][NL]
pretty good about my swordsmanship.[.][A][NL]
I got to a point where I was arrogant[.][NL]
enough to believe no one could best me.[.][A][NL]
Then one day it happened[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's something[NL]
I've never been able to forget.[.][A][OpenMidRight]What happened?[A][OpenMidLeft]It was just another battle. I'd been hired[NL]
on as another sword and then I met him.[.][A][NL]
He was a knight from some country[.][NL]
or another.[.][A][NL]
I had fought knights on several other[.][NL]
occasions and had beaten them all.[A][NL]
Even though he was a bit tougher,[.][NL]
I was sure I'd defeat him in the end.[.][A][NL]
That's what I thought.[A][NL]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][0x02][NL]
His strength was beyond me. I may as well [NL]
have been using a broomstick to fight.[A][NL]
I remember thinking, [0x93]What a tiny little[NL]
world I've been living in.[0x94][.][A][NL]
He crushed me effortlessly, and the wound[.][NL]
he inflicted became this lovely scar.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I was truly frightened. It was the first[NL]
time I'd experienced fear as a mercenary.[.][A][NL]
So this knight saw how scared I was[.][NL]
and said, [0x93]Go.[0x94][.][A][NL]
He didn't kill me.[NL]
He let me escape.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I was humiliated and ashamed.[.][A][NL]
My eyes were finally opened to [.][NL]
my own weakness.[A][NL]
It goes without saying I lost every[.][NL]
shred of self-confidence.[.][A][0x02][NL]
[.....]I still dream about it sometimes.[.][NL]
It wakes me up every time.[A][NL]
I've never forgotten that knight.[.][NL]
He thought I was weak and pathetic.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Chief[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I was young and stupid.[.][NL]
This scar is my punishment.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But that knight[.][NL]
spared your life.[.][A][NL]
Because of that, good things and[NL]
better things have happened?[A][OpenMidLeft]What do you mean, Tethys?[.][A][OpenMidRight]First of all, Chief, you're alive.[A][NL]
If you had died, all the good times[.][NL]
you've had since that day,[A][NL]
and all the joy you're sure to have[.][NL]
from this day onward, wouldn't exist.[.][A][NL]
And another thing, because you lived, you[.][NL]
made many friends and you met me.[.][A][NL]
I also don't think that knight thought[NL]
you were pathetic.[A][NL]
I think he saw a young man with his whole[.][NL]
life ahead of him.[A][NL]
That's why he let you go.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Tethys[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Yep. [.][.....]I'm sure that's it. So try[NL]
thinking about it in a more positive light.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. [....]You're right.[.][NL]
I was a lot calmer after that.[A][NL]
And while I've had hard times,[NL]
there've been far more good times.[A][NL]
I guess you could say I owe my success[NL]
as a mercenary to that knight.[A][OpenMidRight]Yep.[NL]
You've got your knight,[.][A][NL]
and I've got my dancer. Thanks to the[.][NL]
two of them, the two of us are here now.[A][NL]
Say, Chief, why don't we become like them?[A][NL]
I think we should work at being[.][NL]
inspirations to other people.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]good idea.[A][0x02][NL]
Thanks, Tethys.[.][NL]
I think I'll sleep soundly tonight.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Good.[.][.....][NL]
You know, Chief, I'm really happy.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, me, too. I've got a life I enjoy [.][NL]
and good companions.[A][NL]
All that and a wonderful woman to love.[.][NL]
Everyone should be so lucky.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh![.][.....] Chief![.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarLeft][SendToBack][OpenLeft][CloseEyes][OpenFarLeft]Whoa![.][......][NL]

Life's full of surprises, isn't it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I suppose so.[.][A][OpenMidRight]So, what do you think of our commander?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I'm here.[.][NL]
There's your answer.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Good point.[.][A][NL]
You know this job seems to have more[NL]
meaning than any of my previous ones.[.][A][NL]
And it's not because it deals with the[NL]
continent and all the nations and all that.[.][A][NL]
I simply want to accomplish my employer's[.][NL]

[ToggleSmile]You know I was so surprised the[.][NL]
first time I visited Caer Pelyn.[A][NL]
The elder's eyes[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]they were not the[.][NL]
eyes of your average person.[A][NL]
They were filled with a lifetime's wisdom[.][NL]
and seemed to look right through you.[.][A][NL]
Deep[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and sharp.[NL]
And they were so clear.[.][A][NL]
I've looked into the eyes of many people,[.][NL]
but no one had eyes like hers.[A][NL]
But the thing about the elder is that[.][NL]
her eyes weren't harsh, or judgmental.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]That's what I like about her.[.][A][NL]
Actually, when I first met her, she[.][NL]
intimidated me.[.][A][NL]
But she treated me with such kindness.[A][NL]
She's why I grew to enjoy Caer Pelyn, [NL]
even if it doesn't have any nightlife![A][NL]
I want you to take good care of[.][NL]
the elder, Saleh.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Yes, I intend to.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You say the right words, Saleh, but[.][NL]
are you being sincerely considerate?[A][OpenMidRight]Considerate?[A][NL]
When I'm home, I look after [NL]
her personal belongings.[A][NL]
I also take care of her meals and[.][NL]
watch over her health[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]That's only natural. You have no idea[.][NL]
what I'm talking about, do you?[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]That's just like you, though.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Is there[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]something else[NL]

sure you take her a gift.[.][A][NL]

that's popular in town.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
I don't know what she likes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh, please, Saleh.[NL]
That's not the issue.[.][A][NL]
Simply receiving that sort of present[.][NL]
from her grandson will make her happy.[A][OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]is that so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]That's what I'm trying to tell you.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I understand.[.][NL]
I'll take it into consideration.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]When we next pass through a city,[.][NL]
I'll help you pick something out.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That would be helpful.[A][OpenMidLeft]Studying magic is all well and good, but you[NL]

understanding women's hearts.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

My friend Zabba died by your act.[.][NL]

nothing but avenging him![.][A][NL]

That's the truth of it, isn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I trust you now.[NL]
You are my friend.[A][NL]
I'm not lying to you.[.][NL]
I don't lie to my friends.[A][NL]

here, but this war's not our whole lives.[.][A][NL]
Let's not do anything stupid.[.][NL]

You're from Caer Pelyn.[.][A][NL]

his noble personage.[A][NL]

Some monsters had wandered into Caer[NL]

We poor humans cannot hope to grasp[.][NL]

[ToggleSmile]However[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I doubt I should[NL]
stay too long.[A][OpenMidLeft]Why is that?[A][OpenMidRight]It's because I'm a dragon.[A][NL]
My father explained it to me.[.][A][NL]
We are both human and monster.[A][NL]
And because we are both, we[.][NL]
are also neither.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We have the power of dragons; therefore,[NL]
we cannot live together with humans[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
We have the hearts of humans; therefore,[NL]
we do not belong with monsters.[.][A][NL]
We are outcasts in this world, never[NL]
a part of either community.[.][A][NL]
And so we live our lives alone, never[.][NL]
to be understood by anyone.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But there are humans whose actions make[.][NL]
them monsters in the eyes of others.[A][NL]
I do not think of you as such when there are[NL]

practice in the meantime?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Hm. Let me think. Your skill level[NL]
is still quite low, but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thanks, Teacher.[A][NL]
I remember when you first decided[.][NL]
to teach me some magic.[.][A][NL]
I was so excited that I went out[NL]
and practiced over and over again.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]You must pace yourself. Using too much[NL]
magic can drain both body and soul.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah. Boy, I know that.[.][A][NL]

you went to visit Commander Gerik?[A][NL]

you back to Caer Pelyn.[.][A][NL]
I never said thank you for taking me[NL]
in, Teacher. I've never regretted it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]I remember it clearly. I kept thinking,[.][NL]

why did you let me be your student?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Your eyes.[A][OpenMidRight]My eyes?[A][OpenMidLeft]You had a spark in your eyes.[.][A][NL]

I always thought you were angry[.][NL]
with me, and I didn't know why.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]All that because I was so silent[NL]
all the time?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yep. But after a while, I figured[.][NL]
out it was just the way you were.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ewan, you can never find truth in[.][NL]
words, spoken or unspoken.[A][NL]
Truth lives within the heart.[.][A][OpenMidRight]But other people can't see what's[.][NL]
inside your heart, can they?[A][OpenMidLeft]If you can trust one another, you[.][NL]
can see. And you will understand.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Oh! Is that how it works?[.][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I think I get it now.[.][A][NL]
But talking is so important in[NL]
building friendships, isn't it?[.][A][NL]
We use words to communicate things[NL]
like feelings and ideas.[A][NL]
But all that stuff, it's just on[NL]
the surface. Does that mean that[A][NL]
if people use their hearts, they[NL]
can communicate without using words?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's right.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]You really are great, Teacher.[A][NL]
You teach me by making me teach myself,[.][NL]
and I mean more than just magic[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

play in the river[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's right. Then I dropped it and[.][NL]

But how would you do it? Do you have some[.][NL]
sort of magical powers or something?[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, I do, but I've decided that[.][NL]
wouldn't be the best way.[.][A][NL]

would be useful, that's for sure![.][A][NL]
Sounds like fun, too. I'd sure love[.][NL]
to ride about in a flying coach.[A][NL]
Think about it[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]the land spread out below,[NL]
glittering dawn skies[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]and the wind![.][A][NL]
Ah, it all sounds like a dream.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I hope it becomes reality someday.[A][OpenMidRight]Me, too.[A][NL]
I like the way your mind works,[.][NL]
laddie. Let's talk more later.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yep![A][X]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x21][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x23][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Ah, Uncle Dozla.[A][NL]
Listen to this, will you? I've[NL]
been thinking about something new.[A][OpenMidRight]Ooh, I can hardly wait.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Imagine people far away from each[.][NL]
other talking.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Far away? You mean, like, if you[NL]
and I were maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]100 paces apart?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Nope. Farther than that.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]All right, 1,000 paces![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Not even close. Farther still![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]10,000 paces? You must be kidding.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not. And even farther than[NL]
that! For example[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
What if one person were in Frelia,[NL]
and the other person were in Rausten?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]What?![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]That's right! Anyone you could[NL]
think of, you could talk to.[A][NL]
I read about magical devices that[.][NL]
could do the same thing, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Wouldn't it be better if anyone[.][NL]
could do it, and not just mages?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Impressive! I think I see it[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
People could send and receive important[.][NL]
messages instantly, is that it?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]No, even better than that![A][NL]
I'm not talking about just sending[NL]
messages back and forth.[A][NL]
I mean like if they could talk,[.][NL]
just like you and I are now![A][NL]
We wouldn't need messengers at[NL]
all! It would all happen instantly![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I just can't wrap my head around this[.][NL]
one, laddie. It's too much for me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Great, isn't it?[A][NL]
You could contact your people in[NL]
Rausten from anywhere, at any time![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]My, oh my[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]You've got quite[NL]
an imagination, don't you?[A][NL]
The things you come up with always[NL]
surprise me, laddie.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.[.][A][NL]
I used to get in trouble for always[.][NL]
thinking up these outlandish things.[A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! That's a shame, laddie.[.][A][NL]
After all, I'm sure a lot of the things[.][NL]
we have now seemed outlandish once.[.][A][NL]
If nobody dreamed, nothing new would[NL]
ever be created, would it?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Uncle Dozla[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]You always have time to listen to my[NL]
ideas, Uncle. It makes me really happy.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]It's always worth the time to listen to[.][NL]
you youngsters and your ideas.[A][NL]
It's sad, but I know people who are so[NL]
busy that they've no time to spare.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]But me, I've got time. As you know,[.][NL]
I'm one of Princess L'Arachel's men.[A][NL]
I'm not the brightest fellow around, so[.][NL]
she doesn't give me a lot to do.[A][NL]
But that gives me lots of free time, and[NL]
I'm always happy to spend it with you.[A][OpenMidLeft]Thank you. I think you're[.][NL]
the best, Uncle Dozla![A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha! What a nice thing to say.[.][NL]
And I think you're the best, laddie.[A][NL]
I think when you're fully grown, you're[.][NL]
going to be a great and interesting man.[A][OpenMidLeft]Do you really think so?[.][A][OpenMidRight]I do. It's that sparkle in[NL]
your eyes that convinces me.[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Yahoo! Ha ha ha.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm looking forward to the day when I see[.][NL]
one of your ideas made reality.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And that day will surely come.[A][NL]
It's weird[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but there are times when[NL]
I can almost picture a world like that.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.][NL]
Now that would be something.[A][NL]
I'll have to make sure I live[.][NL]
long enough to see it.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yep! And you'll have to[.][NL]
stay my friend, too![A][OpenMidRight]Well, of course![A][X]

[ToggleSmile]You look like you're only[.][NL]

compared to my teacher.[.][A][NL]
You want to see some magic?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]H-here? Now? But[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
isn't that dangerous?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Oh, don't worry. Magic isn't[NL]
just for combat. For example[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Voila! It can do stuff like this![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Wow[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
They're so pretty![A][NL]
All those little lights,[NL]
spinning around together[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Is this really magic?[.][A][OpenMidRight]This?[.][....][NL]
This is magic used to make girls happy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hm?[.][.....] Ah![NL]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, Ewan, stop teasing.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha ha.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha.[A][OpenMidRight]You should show me how good you[.][NL]
are with your lance sometime.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Huh? Um, all right. But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'm sure you'd be bored.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]That's not true.[A][NL]
And even if it were, it's simply[NL]
a matter of how you make it fun.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]How you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]make it fun?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Uh-huh.[.][NL]
Like this war, for example.[.][A][NL]
Well, Amelia, I'll[NL]
see you later![A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey![A][NL]

Ewan?[.][A][NL]
Why did you do that? I thought[NL]
you were one of the enemy![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. We talked about this,[.][NL]
remember? How you make it fun?[A][NL]
I just wanted to make our meeting[.][NL]
here a little more fun.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, it wasn't fun[.][NL]

[ToggleSmile]Whew[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]To be honest, I have been practicing[NL]
even harder lately.[.][A][NL]
But it was all worth it to hear you[.][NL]
say that. Thanks.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Really? No, thank you.[NL]
I like your outfit, too.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A][NL]
Oh, I get it.[.][A][0x02][NL]
You're teasing me again,[NL]
aren't you, Ewan?[.][A][NL]
What was it, again?[.][NL]
[0x93]Making things fun[0x94]?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha. No, that's not[NL]
at all what I was doing.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'm not sure I should believe you.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha ha.[.][A][NL]
Princess Eirika has a similar[.][NL]
outfit. Is that a popular style?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I don't know.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]But it's easy to move in, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]I see. I think it's cute. Especially[NL]
that stain right there.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

[ToggleSmile]Hm, let's see[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I went from Silva to the[NL]
capital on my own once.[.][A][NL]
Now that I think about it, I'd[NL]
never left Grado until now.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Oh, really?[.][A][NL]
My teacher[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]he's the great[NL]
sage Saleh from Caer Pelyn[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
took me out on a training[.][NL]
journey for many months once.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Where did you go?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Lots of different places across Magvel.[.][A][NL]
We went to Renais, Frelia, Rausten, and[.][NL]
Jehanna. Oh, and we went to Grado, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Wow, that sounds great.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, it was a lot of fun! There[NL]
were so many new things to see.[.][A][NL]
Say, Amelia, I just had an idea[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]What is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]When this war is over and we're all at peace,[.][NL]
why don't you and I take a trip together?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh? Just the two of us?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Sure, why not? Does[.][NL]
the idea bother you?[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, it's just[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]There's so much I want[NL]
to show you, Amelia.[A][NL]
How the dark green forests refract the[NL]
morning sun into a million burning emeralds.[A][NL]
The melancholy spectacle of the sun sinking [NL]
slowly beyond an endless horizon.[.][A][NL]
The wind gently coercing vast fields of[.][NL]
wheat to dance, heroic mountain peaks[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Oh, and the gorgeous flower beds that[.][NL]
fill your vision with brilliant colors![.][A][NL]
There are so very many spectacular[NL]
places in the world.[A][NL]
I want to see all of them again[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]but[.][NL]
this time I want to see them with you.[A][NL]
When you see them, you'll really understand[.][NL]
how wonderful it is to be alive.[A][NL]
The feeling will fill your heart and[NL]
make you want to sing with joy![.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]That's so[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]eloquent, Ewan.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]But I understand what you're[NL]
trying to say, and yes. Let's go![.][A][NL]
I want to see all of it and more![.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Great![NL]
Then it's settled.[A][NL]
You know what? This gives us something to[.][NL]
look forward to while this war goes on.[.][A][NL]
Just thinking about it makes my heart[.][NL]
beat faster.[A][OpenMidRight]Ha ha.[A][NL]
You know, Ewan, being around you fills[NL]
me with so much energy.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]And I'm happy when you're around, too.[A][OpenMidRight]I'm looking forward to our trip.[A][NL]
It's one more reason for us to work[.][NL]
quickly to put an end to this war.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yeah, let's do what we can, because[.][NL]
we're definitely taking that trip![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x22][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x23][0x01][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh, I cannot believe it.[A][NL]
There is something very[.][NL]
wrong with this world.[A][OpenMidRight]Hm?! What is it? What's[.][NL]
happened, Princess L'Arachel?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hello, Dozla.[.][NL]
Listen to this.[.][A][NL]
The other day, I paid a visit[.][NL]
to a nearby village.[A][NL]
I found something inconceivable there.[A][NL]
Not one of them had ever heard of the[.][NL]
beautiful banisher of darkness before.[A][OpenMidRight]What?![A][NL]
Even with your anonymous campaign[.][NL]
to rid the world of monstrosities?[A][NL]
I cannot fathom how those people[NL]
could be so uninformed![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Last night, I was so distraught that I[NL]
quite nearly drowned my pillow in tears.[A][NL]
This will never do, Dozla.[A][NL]
I must be more famous. The entire[.][NL]
world must know of my legend.[.][A][NL]
The troubadours must be made to[.][NL]
sing my praises far and wide.[.][A][OpenMidRight]And I'm sure they will![.][A][OpenMidLeft]The five heroes who banished evil[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
My own sacred ancestor[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Oh, to be like them[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I so long[.][NL]
to be praised by the masses, too.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.][NL]
And you shall be, Princess![.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]But I get the feeling that we're going[NL]
to have to change our methodology.[A][NL]
Appealing to the common people is of[NL]
the utmost importance.[A][NL]
First and foremost, we need a plan of[.][NL]
action. A means to win their hearts.[A][NL]
Please, Dozla, I want you to[NL]
think of something, too.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.][NL]

for joy, Princess L'Arachel![A][NL]
I, Dozla, have come up with a[.][NL]
plan of masterpiece proportions![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh! That is good news![A][NL]
Don't keep me waiting, Dozla.[.][NL]
Let me hear it.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha! Here goes![.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]All of the heroes from the dawn of[NL]
time had two names, did they not?[.][A][NL]
So what you need, Princess, is another[NL]
name. Something with oomph![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, Dozla! What a splendid idea![A][NL]
An alias would make it easier for[.][NL]
the people to remember me.[A][NL]
Very well, Dozla, we must come up[.][NL]
with a wonderful epithet for me.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][0x02][NL]
[....]Aha![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]It's come to me, Princess L'Arachel![A][NL]
How do you like the sound of [0x93]the[.][NL]
green-haired battle princess[0x94]?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Um, no.[.][A][NL]
I want something with more force.[.][NL]
Something with more[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]impact.[.][A][0x02][NL]

You're amazing, Princess L'Arachel![.][NL]
What a splendid nickname![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Of course it is.[A][NL]
L'Arachel, [0x93]the beautiful princess of[.][NL]
peerless beauty[0x94]![.][A][NL]

rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha![A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]What we do now is vital[.][NL]
to our success, Dozla.[A][NL]
It wouldn't do for me to ride about[.][NL]
calling myself by my own nickname.[A][NL]
It must be spread about in a[NL]
nonchalant manner.[A][NL]
Dozla, starting now, I want you to refer[NL]
to me exclusively by my epithet,[A][NL]
[0x93]L'Arachel, the beautiful princess of peerless[NL]

Is it working?[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Gwah ha ha![.][NL]

Just recently I saw a group of[NL]
villagers together gossiping.[.][A][NL]

fantastic garb riding around at night.[A][NL]
And they called that enigmatic woman [0x93]the[.][NL]

talking about me then.[A][NL]
At last, I am becoming known amongst[NL]
the people of the land.[.][A][NL]
Those three long trips I took around[NL]
the area were worth the trouble.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.][NL]
You're so right, Princess L'Arachel![A][NL]
There can be no doubt that the[NL]
villagers were appropriately impressed.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yet I find it passing strange.[A][NL]
How is it that no one has[.][NL]
appeared to imitate me?[.][A][NL]
The beautiful banisher of darkness[NL]
was well enough known, after all.[.][A][NL]
It's only natural that someone somewhere[NL]
would have aspired to be like me.[.][A][NL]
The fact that no imitators have appeared[NL]
has me very worried, I must say.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Gwah ha ha![.][NL]
How right you are![A][NL]
But you are peerless, Princess L'Arachel,[.][NL]
as your nickname says![A][NL]
It would be impossible for anyone to[NL]
claim your beauty as her own![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Well, that is true. It certainly was[NL]
not easy for me, after all.[.][A][0x02][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Yet now, I am destined to be[NL]

I wonder how my legend will be passed on[NL]

battle to ensure my name is remembered.[.][A][NL]

Because it will be so special, I[NL]

Got it!?[A][OpenMidRight]Yeah, yeah.[.][NL]
I get it.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Very well. I suggest you devote yourself[NL]

I imagined you'd be.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A][NL]
My father was a merchant. We found[NL]
ourselves invited to many balls.[A][NL]
It was my job to dance with the wives[.][NL]
and daughters of his associates.[A][NL]
I found that I had a taste for it, and[NL]
with practice, I improved my skill.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Is that so? I see[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's not[NL]
fair you kept that secret.[A][NL]
Your dance skills were quite adequate.[A][NL]
Your treatment of ladies, however, is[.][NL]
still sorely lacking. Next[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Uh-oh.[.....][NL]
I really have no time to chat.[A][NL]
I must be going.[NL]
Farewell.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]W-wait a minute, Rennac![......][NL]

sigh when you see someone, Rennac?[A][NL]
You may be a fair dancer, but your[NL]
smooth moves belie your gruff manners.[A][NL]
You should learn from me. If you were[.][NL]
truly happy, you would not sigh so.[.][A][NL]
Tell me, Rennac, what is it that[NL]
makes you happy?[A][OpenMidRight]Makes me happy?[.][A][NL]
Let me see[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I've never really thought about it.[.][NL]
If pressed, I'd have to say gold.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Gold, did you say?[A][NL]
So if you had gold, you would[.][NL]
be happy. Is that it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Well, if you have enough gold, you[NL]
can buy whatever you desire.[A][NL]
Mercenaries work so that they can[.][NL]
get paid. It's why they fight.[A][NL]
Knights fight because they have[.][NL]
sworn oaths, but there is more[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
They've been promised a certain social[NL]
status by fulfilling their oaths.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]So, by getting what you desire,[.][NL]
you can be happy? Is that it?[.][A][OpenMidRight]What do you mean?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Rather than lament over what you do not[.][NL]
possess, you should treasure what you do.[.][A][NL]
That's a very important lesson to learn,[NL]
don't you think?[A][NL]
Isn't that the road to true happiness?[A][OpenMidRight]Princess L'Arachel[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I know you mean well when[.][NL]
you say things like that.[.][A][NL]
But coming from someone who has[.][NL]
everything, it means very little.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]This has nothing to do with[.][NL]
my station in life.[.][A][NL]
And as for you, what need have you[NL]
of money or fame? You have me![A][NL]
Merely serving me must be the[.][NL]
greatest pleasure man can know.[.][A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]So, that's what this is about, is it?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Your employer is sweet and lovely.[A][NL]
That is something most people[.][NL]
dream of having.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Surely you cannot aspire to[.][NL]
happiness greater than this.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I've always wondered, Princess,[.][NL]
how your ego grew so large.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]You complain far too much![A][NL]
Come, Rennac. It's time to go.[NL]
Follow me, and try not to lag.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Ah, Princess L'Arachel![.][.....][NL]

Tell me, lassie, how old are you?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It's impolite to ask a woman her[NL]

Aren't you the sassy one![.][A][NL]
You're still young. I don't think you[.][NL]
need to worry about age just yet.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]And how old are you?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Me? I'm all of forty-seven[NL]

Do you know where I might[.][NL]

But that's not important.[.][NL]
Where is Ephraim?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]If it's Prince Ephraim you're after,[NL]

with Ephraim.[.][A][NL]

Wait. Just think. I must have run[.][NL]
across something like this before.[A][NL]
When Princess L'Arachel was a babe,[.][NL]
and she would begin to cry[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
She would tug on my beard! That[.][NL]
would always make her happy.[A][NL]

There's no shame in fighting alongside[NL]
the man once known as Obsidian.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Mm.[.][A][NL]
Cormag, let us emerge victorious from this[NL]
war, for the things we both believe in.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][X]

# 0x0D44
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x25][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13][0x01][OpenMidRight]Sir Duessel.[A][OpenMidLeft]Well met, Cormag.[.][NL]
I'm impressed by your skills.[.][A][OpenMidRight]They're still far below[.][NL]
yours, General Duessel.[.][A][NL]
By the way, I have a favor I've[.][NL]
been meaning to ask of you.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What is it? Please tell me.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Your stories tell of a small lance you[NL]
carry like a treasure. May I see it?[A][OpenMidLeft]Stories, you say? Am I the subject[NL]
of stories now? Interesting.[A][NL]
Here is the lance you're talking about.[.][NL]
Examine it at your leisure.[.][A][OpenMidRight]It[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It really is[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
It's a Gavaleus[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Oh! You've heard of Gavaleus, have you?[.][A][NL]
You must know quite a bit about the[.][NL]
crafting of weapons.[A][NL]
This is one of Gavaleus's final works.[A][NL]
I have quite a collection of weapons, but[.][NL]
this is among the most beautiful of them.[.][A][NL]
While it can be used in battle, I would[.][NL]
never dull its shine with blood or dirt.[A][NL]
If I ever use this lance, I vow that it[.][NL]
will be only in my own final hour.[A][OpenMidRight]It shines as though it could light[NL]
up the soul of its wielder.[.][A][NL]
You're right. I would hesitate to[.][NL]
stain its beauty with blood, too.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, so you grasp what I mean?[.][ToggleSmile][NL]
Cormag, you have a discerning eye.[A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Thank you.[A][NL]
And yet, I know that I will never[.][NL]
be your equal, General Duessel.[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Come, now.[A][NL]
You know, your brother asked to[.][NL]
see this lance once as well.[A][OpenMidRight]My brother?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes.[A][NL]
You two are so alike. His comments[NL]
mirror your own almost exactly.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Is that so?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]For warriors, our weapons are our lives.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]I'm glad to know you understand that.[.][A][NL]
Someday, you'll be a splendid wyvern[NL]
knight to equal your brother.[.][A][ToggleSmile][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x25][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x13][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I've something I want to show you.[A][NL]
Here it is. This lance.[.][NL]
What do you think of it?[A][OpenMidRight]My![.][.....] It has such power! It[NL]
sends chills down my spine[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I am not nearly strong enough to[NL]
wield a weapon such as this.[A][OpenMidLeft]Hm, you think so? Merely holding this[.][NL]
lance makes me tremble with dread.[A][NL]
Not overly so, but enough to stop[.][NL]
me from wielding it in combat.[A][NL]
This lance[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It can drive its[NL]
wielder to madness.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Madness, you say?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, Cormag. It's a magic weapon of dark[NL]
design that's been in my family for ages.[.][A][NL]
Legend states that the leader of our house[NL]
must always carry it, but never use it.[.][A][NL]
We are prohibited from wielding it until such[.][NL]
a time as madness itself rules the day.[.][A][NL]
It's part of my legacy, and yet[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I made a grave error[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I allowed Valter to use this lance.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You let Valter[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]We were in the middle of a battle.[A][NL]
Valter had broken his lance, and when I[.][NL]
wasn't looking he somehow took this one.[A][NL]
From that moment, he was changed[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
He killed everyone[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]even retreating men.[A][NL]
I took the lance from him when I realized[.][NL]
what had happened, but it was too late.[.][A][NL]
Madness had awakened within Valter and[NL]
was coursing through his body.[A][NL]
From then on, he hungered only for battle[.][NL]
and for blood[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It's not as though Valter was a gentle lamb[.][NL]
before, but now his appetite for violence[.][A][NL]
increased many times over. It's all[.][NL]
because of this cursed lance.[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
That odd light playing around the point[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I thought it looked familiar.[.][A][NL]
It was Valter[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]It's the same light Valter[NL]
had in his eyes on the battlefield.[.][A][NL]
Valter's insane because of this lance.[NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Sir Duessel, if it please you, would you[NL]
let me have this lance?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What? You?[NL]
B-but[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]Are you worried that I will[.][NL]
end up like Valter?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]N-no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]This lance[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]someone needs to master it.[.][NL]
It's just a feeling I have.[.][A][NL]
A weapon is only as good or evil as[.][NL]
the man who wields it.[A][NL]
In the hands of someone just, it can[NL]
be a righteous weapon.[A][NL]
In the hands of the wicked, it's a[NL]
danger to all.[A][NL]
Believe me, I have not been seduced[.][NL]
by this lance.[A][NL]
I merely want to see it used for the[NL]
purpose for which it was forged.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I understand you, Cormag.[.][NL]
I'm going to let you have it.[.][A][NL]
I have no son. I had not yet decided[NL]
to whom I should pass on this legacy.[.][A][NL]
Now I see that leaving it to someone[NL]
whom I trust and believe in is best.[A][NL]
As with me, your admiration of weapons[NL]
is balanced by a healthy respect.[.][A][NL]
You also have a good eye, and you[.][NL]
possess tremendous strength.[A][NL]
The day you are able to wield this lance[NL]
may not be far off at all.[A][NL]
If the madness in this lance can be tamed,[NL]
it may very well be a weapon without equal.[.][A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I never had the courage to wield it, but[NL]
I would love to see it used righteously.[A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I am entrusting it to you.[NL]
I hope you will use it one day.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I accept your gift, Sir Duessel.[A][0x02][NL]
I would receive it once this battle is[NL]
finished and our hearts are calmer.[.][A][NL]
If I were to take it in the heat of[.][NL]
battle, I might become Valter the second.[.][A][NL]
It is a possibility that I cannot dismiss.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I see.[.][NL]
Cormag[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]I'm counting on you.[A][NL]
I look forward to the day I can see[.][NL]
this lance wielded correctly.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Understood.[.][A][NL]
Until that time comes, please try not to[NL]
get yourself killed, [.][ToggleSmile]General Duessel![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ha![.][A][ToggleSmile][X]

Your[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
From the first time I laid eyes[.][NL]
upon you, your face[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

You mean before now? Or before[NL]
I even joined Grado's army?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's right, but I can't recall[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Getting to be my age has its price.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Don't be silly![.][A][NL]
I happen to think you're still[NL]
quite young, General Duessel![.][A][OpenMidLeft]Well, now you've got my attention! What[.][NL]
was it you wanted this old soldier for?[.][A][OpenMidRight]It's just that, even among the younger[NL]
knights, there's no match for you.[A][NL]
And, uh[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Ha ha! I'm not so old that you need to[NL]
worry about propping up my ego, lass.[.][A][OpenMidRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][OpenMidRight]I'm sorry.[A][OpenMidLeft]No, no. There's no need to apologize.[.][NL]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I'm sure I'm not the only one in[NL]
this army who feels that way, either.[.][A][NL]
The fighting's fierce, Amelia.[NL]
You watch yourself![.][A][NL]
When you're near me, I'll make sure[.][NL]
I keep a good eye out for you, too.[.][A][NL]
I'll be there in a flash if you need[NL]
me. Go ahead and fight without worry.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Ah, y-yes, sir![.][NL]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x19][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x25][0x01][OpenMidRight]Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]General Duessel.[A][OpenMidRight]It seems like you've grown quite[NL]
comfortable with the spear.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir! I have, sir.[NL]
Thank you.[A][OpenMidRight]You did well to choose the spear as[.][NL]
your weapon. It suits your height well.[.][A][NL]
It also extends your reach and[NL]
enables you to strike with force.[.][A][NL]
More force, even, than a sword[NL]
could bring to bear in a battle.[A][NL]
All weapons have their own[NL]
unique characteristics.[.][A][NL]
You're familiar with the idea that some[.][NL]
weapons are strong against others?[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Isn't that what they call[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
the weapon triangle?[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, it is. And from the looks of things,[.][NL]
your affinity for the spear is quite good.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]If you continue to practice, you should[.][NL]
continue to improve and grow stronger.[A][OpenMidLeft]Really?[.][.....][NL]
Ah, that makes me happy.[A][OpenMidRight]Mm. To begin with, the spear[NL]
is quite a deep weapon[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Yet the attacks comprise three[NL]
surprisingly simple movements.[A][NL]
Right step, left step, and thrust.[A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]Right step, left step, and thrust[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'm following you.[A][OpenMidRight]Excellent.[NL]
But listen, Amelia.[.][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Y-yes?[A][OpenMidRight]Because they are so simple, they are[NL]
easy to learn but tough to perfect.[.][A][NL]
They are the strongest and most[.][NL]
pure of techniques.[.][A][NL]
When you practice them, practice[NL]
perfecting each gesture.[A][NL]
And remember, the spear is a subtle[.][NL]
and powerful weapon.[A][OpenMidLeft]Yes, sir![.][A][OpenMidRight]Now it goes without saying that other[.][NL]
weapons have their good points, too.[A][NL]
Swords are easy-to-use, all-purpose weapons,[NL]
and axes possess devastating strength.[A][NL]
You should learn to use each weapon type.[.][A][NL]
If you can master them all, you'll be[.][NL]
an unstoppable force.[.][A][NL]
That is, of course, if you can overcome[.][NL]
your own natural affinities.[A][NL]
To begin with, you should work on[.][NL]
mastering one weapon type.[A][NL]
Then you can gradually change weapons[.][NL]
until you can use them all.[.][A][NL]
That's what I have done, you understand.[A][NL]
That's called being multi-proficient.[.][A][0x02][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I'd like to tell you more about different[.][NL]
weapons, but that lecture must wait.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Wow[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
General Duessel, you know so much[.][NL]
about weapons, don't you?[.][A][NL]

up I'd become. [.][ToggleSmile]All right![A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight]What is it? Where are[.][NL]
you rushing off to?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I want to practice the things[.][NL]
you've told me about.[.][A][NL]
The basics[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]right, left, thrust. Right?[.][A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]Mm, that's correct.[.][NL]
But[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I'm happy to see you so enthused, but[.][NL]
do you have any reason to rush so?[A][OpenMidLeft]Um, well[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
There's someone[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]one of the Knights of[.][NL]
Renais[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]to whom I do not want to lose.[A][OpenMidRight]Ah.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]It's not that we're going to fight, or[NL]
that I want to defeat him or anything[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It's just that we're kind of keeping track[NL]
of the other's progress, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]It's just a thing we do.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]I see. I think that should prove to[.][NL]
be a good source of motivation then.[A][NL]
Get to it.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, sir![.][A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I think I'll, um, go and[NL]
practice over there[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I'd be nervous in front of you, so[NL]
[ToggleSmile]I'm going to practice on my own.[A][NL]
I'll be back to show you later.[.][A][ToggleSmile][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight]All right. Understood.[A][OpenMidLeft]Great! See you later![.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][......][OpenMidRight]Ha ha[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Such energy. I feel energized[.][NL]
just being around her.[A][NL]

You can rest easy, Amelia.[NL]
Your mother is alive and well.[A][OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][OpenMidLeft]What!?[A][OpenMidRight]It happened a few years back.[.][A][NL]
I was leading a patrol near[.][NL]
the Grado border.[.][A][NL]
We unexpectedly rode up on a group of[.][NL]
bandits, and a battle ensued.[.][A][NL]
When we had taken care of the bandits,[NL]
we rescued a lone female captive.[.][A][NL]
We figured she had been taken from some[.][NL]
village, but she was in shock.[A][NL]
In fact, her distress was so great, she[.][NL]
had forgotten much about herself.[.][A][NL]
Her body was in such a weakened[.][NL]
state that she could barely walk.[.][A][NL]
We felt such pity for her that we took[NL]
her to a peaceful village we knew of.[.][A][NL]
There, we set up a home for her where[.][NL]
she could recover and live quietly.[.][A][NL]
Some years later, she was restored[NL]
to her former vitality.[.][A][NL]
Slowly, she began to recall the lost[NL]
memories of her past.[.][A][NL]
Only recently did she remember that[.][NL]
she had once had a daughter.[A][NL]
I took time off from my duties and visited[NL]
the village where she had lived.[A][NL]
But the villagers told me her daughter[NL]
had left the village some time ago.[.][A][NL]
With no clues as to the girl's whereabouts,[.][NL]
I'd almost given up hope of finding her.[A][NL]
And then, in the strangest of places[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]I-it can't be! Th-that woman[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
What is her name?[.][A][OpenMidRight]Her name is Melina[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]

Are you[.][ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Are you sure?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, I am. I see Melina's[.][NL]
face reflected in your own.[.][A][NL]
There's no mistake.[.][.....][NL]

If you can see the water, you can read[NL]
the flow, the ripples, the waves.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Hmm[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]It is possible, General. Possible[.][NL]
and, at times, easy. Just think of it:[A][NL]
If you knew a storm was coming in advance,[NL]
you could evacuate everyone in its way.[.][A][NL]
If you could see what was to come, you[NL]
could help those who might have died.[.][A][NL]
Prince Lyon explained this to us with[.][NL]
much joy in his voice and heart.[A][NL]
His power would, at long last, be able[NL]
to help the citizens of Grado.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]We continued our work. There were[.][NL]
ceremonies, rituals[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]such horrors[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
And then we saw it.[.][A][NL]
In the near future, Grado would be[NL]
ravaged by catastrophe.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]A catastrophe? Do you[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]No, it's not the conflict in which[NL]
we are currently embroiled.[.][A][NL]
This event is still in our future.[A][NL]
We saw Grado. We saw the earth[NL]
crumble. We saw our people dying.[.][A][NL]
We saw the shape our future would take.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What?[.][NL]
That's madness[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Idiocy![.][A][NL]
I've lived a long life, and I've[NL]
never heard of anything like that.[A][NL]
Not ever.[.][A][OpenMidRight]I am not surprised that you do not[NL]
believe me, General.[A][NL]
We could not believe it, either. We[.][NL]
tried to disprove what we had seen.[.][A][NL]
But nothing could shake the vision.[.][A][NL]
In this disaster, Grado would be[NL]
destroyed. Countless would die.[.][A][NL]
Those who died quickly would be[.][NL]
spared the slow horror of starvation.[.][A][NL]
This was when the emperor died, by the[NL]
way. Lyon was shattered by despair.[.][A][NL]
He devoted himself to research, and[.][NL]
then came the Dark Stone[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]So that's what happened?[A][NL]
Is that when the decision[.][NL]
to invade Renais was made?[A][OpenMidRight]I don't know.[.][A][NL]
Only one person knows[.][NL]
the truth behind that.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I have told you only the[NL]
truths I have seen.[.][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x25][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x29][0x01][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Knoll.[A][OpenMidRight]Is that you, General Duessel?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]You're tired, aren't you?[.][NL]
Worn to the bone.[.][A][NL]
I understand how you feel, but on the[.][NL]
battlefield, this only invites death.[.][A][OpenMidRight]You are probably right[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
And yet that might be best.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]What are you planning to[NL]
do from here on?[A][OpenMidRight]I do not know[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I have lost my way.[.][A][NL]
Perhaps I should have been[NL]
executed in the capital.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I once studied dark magic[.][NL]
alongside Prince Lyon.[A][NL]
He was such a gentle soul. You could[NL]
see it[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove]he was too kind to survive.[.][A][NL]
Prince Lyon dreamt of finding happiness[.][NL]
for all of Grado's citizens.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]And now, Prince Lyon is no more.[A][NL]
I have lost everything.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]I have also lost everything.[A][NL]
And we have both lost our ways.[.][A][NL]
We are dead men who have stayed[.][NL]
too long away from our graves.[A][NL]
But remember, Knoll[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
You cannot see the future, but you[NL]
can look back at your past.[.][A][NL]
Look and learn. And remember.[.][A][NL]
What gave your life meaning, and what[.][NL]
has taken meaning from you now?[.][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]If you still hold the convictions that[NL]
guided you in Grado, you can start anew.[A][NL]
That[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]That is what I must do.[.][A][NL]
We may be diminished by our shame, but[NL]
we are not dead yet, my friend.[.][A][OpenMidRight]General Duessel[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I am not as strong as you.[A][NL]
Still, [.][ToggleSmile]I believe you are right.[NL]
I, too, shall search for a new path.[A][0x02][NL]
[ToggleSmile]A path that guides me to realizing the[NL]
dreams Prince Lyon once held so dear.[.][A][X]
