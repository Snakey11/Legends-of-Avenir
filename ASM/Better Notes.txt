located at a fixed point in memory (FE8U:02024E68), capable
of holding up to 0x40 Proc States (the amount of memory
used by the array is thus 0x40*0x6C=0x1B00 bytes. 02024E68 - 2026968).

MAPS:
Map size: 202D200 (FE6) 202E3D8 (FE7) 202E4D4 (FE8) 202E4D0 (FE8J): Has length and height as halfwords. Note: These are 1-aligned, not 0-aligned.

There's a table of pointers immediately afterwards:

FE6		FE7		FE8		Description
202D204 202E3DC	202E4D8	Unit map (allegiance byte)
202D208 202E3E0	202E4DC	Terrain map (tile id)
202D20C 202E3E4	202E4E0	Movement map (movement cost to move to a specific tile when selecting a character; 0xFF else)
202D210 202E3E8	202E4E4	Range map (nonzero if square can be reached/targeted)
202D214 202E3EC	202E4E8	Fog (nonzero if square can be seen)
202D218 202E3F0	202E4EC	Unknown (code at 18592 in FE8 suggests this is a bitfield, which isn't spectacularly helpful)
202D21C 202E3F4	202E4F0	Backup movement map (seems to be used when exiting the moveable tile zone and entering on another tile to calculate the new path, also used for enemy movement?) (also filled in with squares covered by magic seals prior to displaying red squares when selecting a unit in FE7)
202D220 202E3F8	202E4F4	Middle of the unit map? Seems unused
202D224 202E3FC	202E4F8	Middle of the unit map? Seems unused

The pointers at these locations point to another table of row pointers for that particular map. A row pointer, as the name suggests, points to the beginning of a row. Given a set of coordinates, you can retrieve the map data at that file with the following (assume r0 = x and r1 = y):
ldr		r2,Map_Offset	@Load the location in the table of tables of the map you want
ldr		r2,[r2]			@Offset of map's table of row pointers
lsl		r1,#0x2			@multiply y coordinate by 4
add		r2,r1			@so that we can get the correct row pointer
ldr		r2,[r2]			@Now we're at the beginning of the row data
add		r2,r0			@add x coordinate
ldrb	r0,[r2]			@load datum at those coordinates

NOTE: Each row seems to have an extra two bytes as a buffer. This also helps explain why the largest map possible is NOT a square; a new row costs 6 more bytes than a column, due to needing an extra row pointer + buffer.

############
CHARACTER AND BATTLE STRUCT:

Each character has a 0x48-byte struct in RAM that stores things like status, location, stats, etc, beginning at 202AB78 (FE6), 202BD50 (FE7), or 202BE4C (FE8).
The battle structs (which is more of an 'inter', since it gets called for non-battle stuff as well) are 0x80 bytes long, of which the first 0x48 are essentially the same as the character structs. There are two of these, one for the attacker/instigator at 203A3F0 (FE7)/203A4EC (FE8) and one for the defender/target at 203A470 (FE7)/203A56C (FE8).
FE6-Attacker at 2039214 and defender is at 2039290

Character struct:
Byte	Type	Description
0x00	Word	Pointer to character data
0x04	Word	Pointer to class data
0x08	Byte	Level
0x09	Byte	Experience
0x0A	Byte	Seems to be used for AI decisions since the value here depends on weapon type/range/other things (3C120 deals with this?)
	0x01		Has magic weapon
	0x02		Has staff
	0x04		Has item with staff/use effect (byte 0x1E in item data) as 1-5 (healing staff) or 0x21-0x22 (vulnerary/elixir)
	0x08		Has item 0x51 (silence)
	0x10		Has item 0x52 (sleep)
	0x20		Has item 0x53 (berserk)
	0x40		Has weapon with more than 1 range
	0x80		?
0x0B	Byte	Allegiance byte; top two bits are used for allegiance (0x00 for player, 0x40 for NPC, 0x80 for enemy) and to retrieve character data using the unit map (see Map section)
0x0C	Word	Turn/Status bitfield, as follows (most are unknown/not used): NOTE: FE6 ONLY HAS 2 BYTES FOR THIS
	Byte 0xC
	0x01		Selected/not drawn
	0x02		Unselectable
	0x04		Dead (used in conjunction with 0x1 to not display)
	0x08		Not deployed
	0x10		Rescuing someone
	0x20		Being rescued
	0x40		Moved this turn/canto-ing
	0x80		On a roof tile (basically, a do-not-display). Checked at 79FFC. Also skips displaying danger zone at 1B894.
	
	Byte 0xD
	0x01		Makes the movement squares appear over the standing map sprites, but the function at 1895C clears this from all units every time a unit is selected. Checked at 27260. May be related to bit 0x2, since if that's set outside the link arena, if you select and deselect a unit, 0x2 is cleared and 0x1 is set.
	0x02		In the link arena, doesn't display map sprite if you set 'Hide Units' to On (and presumably calls function to display that weird arrow thing instead)
	0x04		Gets cleared when being danced, but no idea what it does (set at 39B92, cleared at 18836) (doesn't seem to be read; maybe part of a special AI)(definitely AI related)
	0x08		Inside ballista
	0x10		Drop last item
	0x20		Afa's drops/Metis tome
	0x40		Solo Animation 1
	0x80		Solo Animation 2
	
	Byte 0xE
	0x01		Something about not being drawn? Checked at 34298, amongst others
	0x02		After battle, store turn word from battle struct to char data, then store these 3 bits at 3003060 (2C20A), but doesn't seem to be used there
	0x04		^ (also written at 2CE60 and 317AA) (not used here either)
	0x08		^ However, B5998 checks if 0x08 and either 0x04 or 0x02 are set; if true, it actives a super-arena mode (different conversation and higher-level enemies). They still don't seem to get set, however, and the alternate text is glitchy.
	0x20		Not deployed in previous chapter
	0x40		In a cutscene?
	0x80		Increase portrait index by 1
	
	Byte 0xF
	0x01		Makes the standing map sprite shake very quickly (checked at 27270)
	0x02		No idea, but is checked at 34298 and 1239E
	0x08		Link arena palette (checked at 27146)
	0x40		Unused as far as I know; used by me for Capture

The data from here on is for the battle struct only

Byte	Type	Description
0x48	Short	Equipped item and uses after battle
0x4A	Short	Equipped item and uses before battle
0x4C	Word	Equipped item's weapon ability word (+0x8 in item struct) (only a halfword in FE6, so everything after this will be off by 2)
0x50	Byte	Weapon type; writes appropriate magic type if using a magic sword (hardcoded to item id, function at 2A882 (FE8)
0x51	Byte	Inventory slot of equipped weapon? (8 for in ballista) (should always be 0 for battle since equipped item moves to the top of the list?)

0x7C	Byte	Bool; true if damage is non-zero (used in exp calculations) 
0x7D	Byte	Bool; true if weapon broke
0x7E	Byte	??; 1D1E6 and 322C4 set this to 0, but it doesn't seem to be read
0x7F	Byte	?? (seems to be unused)

Just before the attacker's battle struct is data used to display the pre-battle numbers and calculate the rounds data
203A4D4 (FE8) 203A4D0 (FE8J)
0x00	Short	Seems to be a bitfield (0x2 seems to be 'battle hasn't started yet') (0x20 is arena) (0x80 is staff?)

CHARACTER BATTLE STATISTIC STRUCT (203E884) (FE6: 203D524)
More commonly known as the B/W/L table, this holds a bunch of (relatively useless) statistics that no one cares about. If you need room to save something, odds are this is a good place to start. There are 0x45 entries, each 0x10 bytes long.

+0x00	Losses
+0x01	Number of times a unit performs an action (seems to increase by 2) (non-aligned halfword)
+0x03	Number of times selected (caps at 199)
+0x04	Number of times viewed in stat screen (caps at 199)
+0x05	Lower 4 bits are the (most recent) chapter number they died on, upper 4 bits (along with byte 0x6) are the turn number they died on
+0x06	See above
+0x09	Top 4 bits, along with 0xA, is exp gained this chapter
+0x0A	See above
+0x0B	Along with bottom 2 bits of 0xC, wins
+0x0C	Bottom 2 bits are wins, top 6 bits, along with the bottom 6 bits of 0xD, are battles
+0x0D	See above
+0x0E	Character number of the most recent killer

? is a break on read
!! is a break on write
! is a break on write if the new value is different from the old
!? or !!? is break on both read and write (write adhering to the same rules as above). The order of ! and ? don't matter.
So if I want to set a break on read to 202BCFE, I would write [202BCFE]? in the Set Breakpoint box.
You can also set a break on read/write to a range of memory. Simply put the two addresses in brackets, separated with 2 periods:
[202BCFE..202BD0D]? will break upon reading any value between those two offsets, including the endpoints.
Note that the game will pause after executing the command that did the read/write.

You can set conditions to a break. For instance, you might want to break on the
current line only if r2 is 0. Simply press Ctrl + B, enter your address (you can
use $ for the current line), and separate the
conditions with a comma, like $, r2 = 0.
You can also use the conditions by themselves: a break when r2 = 0
would be written as r2 = 0. Of course, that will almost certainly
bring up a ton of false breaks if you’re looking for a specific
instance of r2 = 0, but that’s part of the fun! Right? …Right? Ok,
I guess it’s not fun, but you’ll have to put up with it anyway.
Also, please note you can only have one break on execution per
address, and only one condition per breakpoint.
