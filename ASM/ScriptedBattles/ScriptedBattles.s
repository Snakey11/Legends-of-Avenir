SetScriptedNumbers: @ jumpToHack at 0x08011FD0. Reee too small for an autohook.
@ Replaces the function call to 0x08011EC8.
@ Instead of running calculations for the number display, let's grab the numbers from memory slots.
@ We'll want to set damage, hit %, and crit % for each unit. That's 6 shorts. We can use 3 memory slots as parameters.
@ Since memory slot 0x1 is already used for scripted battle macros, let's use slots 0x2, 0x3, and 0x4 for hit, damage, and crit respectively.
@ The attacker's value will be in the lower short, and the defender's value will be in the higher short.
@ r7 seems to be the attacker's character struct, and r8 seems to be the defender's character struct.
@ r4 is some proc. r5 is the action struct + 0x1C. r6... may be a boolean? Haven't seen it nonzero.
