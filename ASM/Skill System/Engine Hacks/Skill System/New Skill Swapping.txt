I added a new way to swap skills in and out, there are two new files, skill_descriptions and skill_icons
those files come with macros and all existing skills already done

in the new options file you'll find some definitions that, when uncommented, will make the whole thing included
they can work together with the csv and the skillicons.png, but will work on it's own without those as well
I did it this way so people that are already in a project don't have to be bothered

the objective is to provide an easy way to swap skills in and out for the future
when we hit the cap getting a skill out will be as simple as defining it's id to 0xFF

so
REMEMBER:
when adding a new skill, on top of adding the description in the csv and the icon in the skillicons.png
add an image with the icon alone (and proper palette) to the Skill Icons folder, then use the macros in the
corresponding files to set everything up

ISSUES:
we could probably use something that complains if two skills have the same id (and it's not 0xFF)
also apparently characters can learn skills with id 0xFF which probably should not be a thing
