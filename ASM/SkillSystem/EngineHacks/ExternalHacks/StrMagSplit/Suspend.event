/*
Original Notes
114C bytes starting from 2E78

size of unit struct: 0x48
Size of Player Units pool: 51 * 0x48 =  0xE58
Size of Enemy Units pool: 50 * 0x48 = 0xE10
Size of Npc Units pool: 10 * 0x48 = 0x2D0
0xE58 + 0xE10 + 0x2D0 = 0x1F38

Original Sizes:
size of packed unit struct: 0x34
Size of Player Units pool: 51 * 0x34 =  0xA5C
Size of Enemy Units pool: 50 * 0x34 = 0xA28
Size of Npc Units pool: 10 * 0x34 = 0x208
0xA5C + 0xA28 + 0x208 = 0x168C

So By Moving the debuffs into the old Unit Pool, we could save the entire unit struct, while still keeping debuffs.
