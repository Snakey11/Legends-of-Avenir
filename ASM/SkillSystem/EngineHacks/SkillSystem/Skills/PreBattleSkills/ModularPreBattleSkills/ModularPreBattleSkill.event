// 
// Hp Costs use byte 0x4 of the battle buffer, which I've named as: injured self already (CmbArt Hp Cost)
// Follow-up attacks will not cost additional hp, but multi-hit skills will cost extra hp for each attack.
// Giving Sol an hp cost will prevent it from healing. 
//
// CBS = Character Battle Structure
// It accepts inputs from the below lists.
// Anything else has no effect & breaks from the loop.
// The pre-battle loop doesn't seem to allow for anything outside the range of 0x5A-0x6C
// So the byte list seems to be useless.

0x5A	Short	Attack
0x5C	Short	Defense
0x5E	Short	Attack Speed

/*
SkillID 
If a unit has this Skill, they will gain the effects you specify in the PreBattleSkillTable.
0xFF applies to no skills.

CmbArtID
If an entry has a cmb art id, the effect will only take place when using that cmb art.
0x00 makes the skill always have that effect.
0xFF makes the skill never have any effect . 

OperationX
Accepts the following inputs:
0 = Do nothing & break from loop
1 = Addition
2 = Subtracts unit's current value by specified amount
3 = Fraction (4-bit): eg. 0x32 = multiply by 3, then divide by 2
4 = LsFraction (4-bit): 0x32 = shift left by 3 (eg. multiply by 2^3=8), then right by 2 (divide by 4)
5+ = Do nothing & break from loop

ValueX
Modifies the unit's battle stat by this value. 
Final values that end up as >0x7F (#127) will become 127.
