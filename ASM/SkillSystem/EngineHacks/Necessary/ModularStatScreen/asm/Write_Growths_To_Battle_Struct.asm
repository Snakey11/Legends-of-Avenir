mov		r14,r1			@ this is a function call to Can_Gain_Exp routine, which is out of normal BL range
.short	0xF800			@ BL lr+0 (returns 1 if person can gain exp, 0 if false)
cmp		r0,#0x0			@ compare r0 to 0 (ie, did it return false)
bne		Label1			@ (branch if not equal) using this here because the function is be too long to beq to directly (branch with comparison operator has a shorter range than direct branch)
b		GoBack			@ if false, we're done here
Label1:
ldrb	r0,[r7,#0x9]	@ LoaD Register (r0) with Byte. Which byte? The one written at the location pointed to by (r7+0x9). In the battle struct, this is the unit's exp.

bhi		Label2			@ if it's higher than 99, keep going
b		GoBack			@ otherwise, the character's not levelling up and we are done here
Label2:

ldrb	r1,[r7,#0x8]	@ again, load register r1 with byte; here it's r7+0x8, which is the unit's level
add		r1,#1			@ add 1 to the unit's level

ldr		r2,[r7,#0x4]	@ load register r2 (with word) (it's not written, but it's implied) at r7+4. This is the character's (ROM) class data pointer
ldrb	r2,[r2,#0x4]	@ load register r2 with the byte at address (r2 + 4). If you look at the Class Editor.nmm, the 4th byte is the class number
ldr		r3,Class_Level_Cap_Table	@ our table containing the level cap for each class
ldrb	r2,[r3,r2]		@ load reg r2 with the byte contained at the address (r3 + r2), which would be the class's level cap

mov		r1,r7			@ copy battle struct to r1
add		r1,#0x6E		@ add 0x6E
ldrb	r2,[r1]			@ load byte at this location. Teq doq reveals that battle struct+0x6E is the experience this unit gained during this battle/interaction
sub		r2,r2,r0		@ subtract r0 from r2 and put the result in r2
strb	r2,[r1]			@ and store that result back to battle struct+0x6E. Why? Because we don't want to show the unit gaining exp past the level cap.
mov		r0,#0xFF		@ put 0xFF in r0
Label3:
strb	r0,[r7,#0x9]	@ store the new exp. If the unit is capped, then we stored 0xFF (because we didn't skip the branch above), otherwise, we stored (exp - 100)

@This next part is writing the growths.
@The vanilla growth function is designed so that it's hard to get no-stat level-ups if none are capped. First, we go through all the stats and see whether any leveled up. If none did, then we do another pass until either a) a stat procs, or b) we looped through all stats again. Once done, we check if the level-up makes the stat go over its cap, and set that accordingly.

ldr		r0,Growth_Options	@ bit 1 is set if we should check for fixed growths mode
mov		r1,#0x1
tst		r0,r1				@ tst is a combination of 'and r0,r1; cmp r0,#0' except it doesn't store the result in a register, merely sets the z flag if the comparison is true (ie, r0&r1=0)
beq		NormalGrowths		@ if the bit isn't set, we go straight to the normal growths routine
lsr		r0,#0x10			@ logical shift right by 0x10 places (divide by 2^16, which strips the lower 2 bytes of this word)
ldr		r1,Check_Event_ID	@ bytes 2 and 3 of the opinion word are a (permanent) event ID, which is set if fixed growths are on (makes it easy to toggle)
mov		r14,r1
.short	0xF800				@ returns true (1) if the event id is set
cmp		r0,#0
beq		NormalGrowths		@ if not set, go to normal growths routine
b		FixedGrowths		@ if it's set, go to fixed growths routine

NormalGrowths:

mov		r4,#0			@ zeroing out r4 to use as a flag.
mov		r5,#0			@ zeroing out r5 to use as a counter.

HpGrowth:
ldr		r0,Get_Hp_Growth
mov		r14,r0			@ use the longcalling trick to bl to Get_Hp_Growth, whose location will be determined in the EA file
mov		r0,r7			@ that function takes the character struct as a parameter (character data forms the first 0x48 bytes of the battle struct, so it doesn't matter which one is used)
.short	0xF800			@ when we return, r0 will have the hp growth (which takes into account metis tome and any growth boosters the character has)
mov		r14,r6			@ now we call the function Calc_Level_Up
.short	0xF800			@ which returns the actual level-up number
mov		r1,r7
add		r1,#0x73
strb	r0,[r1]			@ store the hp growth to (battle struct+0x73), which will then be read later for the level-up display
add		r5,r0			@ add r0 (level-up number) to r5 (counter) and store it in r5 (this is equal to add r5,r5,r0)
cmp		r4,#0x0			@ checking if the flag has been set
beq		StrGrowth		@ if not, go to the next growth
cmp		r5,#0x0			@ if flag is set, check whether a stat proc'd yet
beq		StrGrowth		@ if no stat proc'd, go to next growth
