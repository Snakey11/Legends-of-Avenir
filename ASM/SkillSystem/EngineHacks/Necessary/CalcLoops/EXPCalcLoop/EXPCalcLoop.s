EXPCalcLoop: @ Autohook to 0x0802b960. This is gonna be kinda weird tbh.
@ THE PLAN: Loop through EXPCalcFunctions twice: Once for the attacker and once for the defender.
@ Also edit any functions called to take a character (really battle I suppose) struct as an argument. (Also assume they return the changed EXP value)
@ r0 = attacker's EXP, r4 = defense struct, r5 = attack struct.
mov r6, r5
add r6, r6, #0x6E @ r6 is used later in the vanilla function to load EXP. Use r4 and r5.
push { r7 }
cmp r0, #0x00
beq AttackerStore @ Immediately end if 0 EXP is passed through.
@ Now to loop through all functions in EXPCalcFunctions for the attacker.

	mov lr, r3
	.short 0xF800 @ Each function takes EXP as the first parameter and returns their edited value.
	add r7, r7, #0x04
	b AttackerLoop
EndAttackerLoop:
@ So r0 = EXP to store.
cmp r0, #100

	mov r0, #100 @ As a final measure, ensure EXP doesn't exceed 100.

@ Same deal now except for the defender. First calculate defender's EXP.
