Notes for Gamma on what we're thinking about UI:

We've been looking closely at the overall UI edits for Ternon and SE, and we've got new ideas for what we're thinking (mostly regarding the general UI tilemap).

Borders:
We noticed that Ternon went for a more paper-like border, and SE has a straighter, more shadowed border. We like the SE border more.
Would a small flair on corners of borders be feasible?
We were hoping that we could replace the vanilla dragon on the top border with a design that we're still developing too.

Colors:
We're thinking of a green/blue/gold color scheme. Maybe teal as a primary color, slightly dark blue for secondary, and gold for borders.
For gradients that transition to a darker base in vanilla, we were wondering if we could instead transition to our dark blue secondary color.
Because of this choice for background colors, we may want to change number palettes: For numbers that would be blue in vanilla, we think something red might work better.

Background:
We got ahead of ourselves with thinking about designs for the stat screen, battle screen, etc. It's probably best to start with the general tilemap and go from there.
