Notes on the outputted graphics/desired TSA:
    Although the end result should be lz77 compressed, there's a lot that can be done BEFORE oompression.
    We can take advantage of the fact that palette bank "tile sets" should be entirely and completely mutually exclusive of one another.
        i.e. no two banks should share a tile, and the entire image should be composed of tiles.
    Png2Dmp uncompressed outputs are nicely ordered for us. Hex data goes from tile to tile from left to right downwards. Pixel hex (4bpp) within each tile also go left->right down.
    Each pixel refers to the index of the color used. Png2Dmp standard output only outputs graphics data.
    
    TSA is weird:
        1st byte is width (of the entire image) - 1, 2nd byte is height - 1 in tiles. For the small world map, this is 0x1D and 0x13 respectively.
        After this, each displayed tile on the screen is represented by a short.
            Lower byte and lower nibble of the higher byte make the tile ID of the IMAGE to use.
            Higher nibble of the higher byte is the palette (relative to the image) to use, execpt...
            Top 2 bits are horizontal and vertical flips. We don't care about those.
        When generating what's to be displayed on-screen, TSA reads first bottom left, moving right then upwards.

OUR GOAL:
    Read a list of files to read data from. Each file is a PNG image that represents a single palette bank.
        These files should be requantized to 16 colors with the first being transparent. All tiles NOT used by this bank are entirely transparent.
    We're going to use Png2Dmp to extract our raw graphics and essentially "orr" them from each image together into one that can be compressed.
    At the same time, we should be able to generate TSA with correct palette referenced!
    Because the first tile of the image needs to be transparent, there's a weird final step we need to do.
        We need to extend the height of the image by one tile, filling it with transparent tiles.
        Then, we move the top leftmost tile of the image down to the new bottom rightmost tile. Weird, but luckily, I don't think this affects TSA?
